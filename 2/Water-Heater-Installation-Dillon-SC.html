<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) requires plumbing contractors to get a plumbing license prior to setting up or replacing a backflow preventer. Supplied there isn't a tank failure, typically a commercial hot water heater can be fixed, but is it worth repairing? Only after answering the following concerns need to you answer repair or replace. Do you know how many years old your hot water heater is? Do you understand the number of years it's rated for? Think about replacement instead of repair if it is close to the number of years the water heater was ranked for.</p>
<p>If there is backflow at your house, you might infect your drinking water with non-treated water from a watering canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it.
