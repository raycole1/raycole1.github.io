<p>To lower the need of gas line repair, it is necessary to understand the typical causes of gas leakages. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning appliances take place most frequently in the winter. This is since homes are not effectively ventilated throughout the cooler months to avoid heat loss. We suggest installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to inform you of any possible gas leakages if you haven't done so already.</p>
