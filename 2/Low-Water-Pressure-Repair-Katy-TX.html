That slow, constant outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing totally. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water spots and corrosion.
