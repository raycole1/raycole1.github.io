<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is normal in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can attain this.</p>
