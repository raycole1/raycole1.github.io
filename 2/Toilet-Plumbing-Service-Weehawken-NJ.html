<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by hooking up a hose to drain the tank to an ideal drain. Flushing the water heating tank ought to be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might provide a fast fix in the short term, it can cause far more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.
