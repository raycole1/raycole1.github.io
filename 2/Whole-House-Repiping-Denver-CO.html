<p>The consumer has one month to complete installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (inspect the due date on Notification of Requirements form). The majority of the time, a professional plumber can come out and find the problem and make the repairs. In some circumstances, the toilet might be too old, and replacement parts are not readily available, so a replacement toilet is needed.</p>

Nevertheless, particles in between the # 1 Inspect Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the parts, is avoiding the # 1 Examine from closing all the way. This permits pressure to adjust in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Minimized Pressure. When this occurs, the Relief Valve Spring presses back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
