<p>Aside from these two crucial components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less critical things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.
