The answer is: you need backflow prevention if you have a cooking water connection that may be used to supply a lawn sprinkler.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most apparent signs of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be).
