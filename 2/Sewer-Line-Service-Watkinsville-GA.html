This can increase the amount of time required to install the brand-new unit, therefore increasing expenses. This really depends upon what condition the rest of the pipes remain in, and how difficult the old unit is to eliminate. Oftentimes, elimination will just add an extra $25 to $50 to the overall costs, however in many cases the costs might be greater if extra pipes must also be changed.</p>

After they offered me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, given that I never want to see this company again.</p>
