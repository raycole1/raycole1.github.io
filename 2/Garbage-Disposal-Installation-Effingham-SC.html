<p>Electric water heaters do have a few disadvantages however that are worth explaining. Firstly, electrical energy is not as inexpensive as gas. Some energy companies charge higher rates for electrical power during peak periods such as extremely early in the early morning and at night. Utilizing your heater during these peak durations can increase your power costs. On the hand, gas is inexpensive and has a fixed rate. Another disadvantage of an electrical hot water heater is that they can be costly to install, particularly when it concerns whole-house tankless systems.</p>
<p>Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline prior to the issue got worse. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a really costly alternative.</p>
