<p>Sewer lines can fail for a range of factors, including bad soil conditions, clogs from grease and gunk, and deterioration. Even trees and bushes can trigger problems for sewer lines, especially in older areas where clay pipe may have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as compounded if pipes have actually been allowed to freeze.</p>
<p>In community water system systems, water is usually maintained at a significant pressure to enable water to flow to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your house or company. When the pressure drops for some reason such as may take place when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to fight a fire or a water main breaks or some other scenario takes place, polluted water might be drawn into the system.
