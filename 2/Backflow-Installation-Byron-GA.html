<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services Byron GA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX.

As these leaks happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these problems.</p>
