<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual preference. A permit is not required for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A typical water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a close-by drainpipe or drywell.</p>

While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
