<p>Softeners mainly get rid of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently described as 'firmness minerals'.

When Kenz plumbing initially detects a leak as being under the slab, 3 choices are offered to the homeowner. Salt does not have the opportunity to enter drinking water through softening installations.
