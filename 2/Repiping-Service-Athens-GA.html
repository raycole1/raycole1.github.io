Some disposer systems do not come with a power cable attached. If this holds true, eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1).

Guarantee the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cable when you connect the electrical wiring harness to the disposer.</p>
