The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively utilized in the U.S.A. during the 20th century.
