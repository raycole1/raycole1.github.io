<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically two layers of defense. The device allows water to press the check valves open when water is coming into the structure, but closes them shut when water tries to go the wrong way. There are 2 different types of testable backflow prevention devices that are commonly defined-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a few others that I will discuss but do not get hung up on them. Since they will be on an accreditation test, I discuss them only.</p>
