In bathrooms, showers, tubs and sinks become clogged with hair and soap, and toilets can become clogged with toilet tissue.

<h3>Sewer Pipe Repair in Mukilteo Washington</h2>
<p>When you need a water heater replacement, there are a number of things that you must consider to help you choose. A good general rule of thumb is that when your present water heater reaches its 10th birthday, you need to start getting ready for a replacement.

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent man. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as promised. I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be higher.</p>
