<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called deterioration.

If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
