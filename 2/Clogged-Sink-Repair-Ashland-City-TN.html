The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can happen, preventing contaminating water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more complicated and sophisticated backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical gadgets set up to prevent backflow variety from the fairly basic to the very advanced and complicated.</p>
