<p>Pipeline video inspection is a form of telepresence utilized to visually inspect the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A common application is for a plumber to determine the condition of small diameter sewer lines and household connection drain pipes. With unique root nozzles, we can clean and clear most of the roots, rust, and debris to prepare the line for possible CIPP lining reinstatement if the pipe needs to be fixed.
