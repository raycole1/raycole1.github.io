<p>You reside in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old.

This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
