<p>And so, we see the shift from substantial transport pipelines (aqueducts) providing water to whole cities to large distribution pipes (mains) servicing smaller sized communities or big centers, to medium distribution pipelines and lastly to small service pipelines.

<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it simply suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing major and regular leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. If you do have frequent leakages, we find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and much better long-lasting solution.</p>
