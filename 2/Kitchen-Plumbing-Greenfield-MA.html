To avoid deterioration from rust, storage tanks are geared up with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by bring in harmful products. By having the anode rod checked frequently and replaced as needed, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Leaks can take place if the seal between the tank and bowl stops working, or the seal at the floor drain stops working. Due to the fact that the tank or the whole toilet need to be lifted off the floor for an appropriate repair, either of these leaks can be difficult to fix by yourself. Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a far more costly repair. Ryan's Plumbing has carefully trained workers who will treat your toilet and house with the utmost care.</p>
