<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
