Mr. Singh did at least 3 attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl.

With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the freshly cleaned main drain. By adding perseverence and patience the job was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>
