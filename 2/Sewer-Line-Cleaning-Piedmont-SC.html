<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
