<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains significant amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a nuisance-- for its many designated uses around your house.</p>
