The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.
