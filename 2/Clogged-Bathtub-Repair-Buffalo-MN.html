<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of little, maybe less crucial things that can deteriorate or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
