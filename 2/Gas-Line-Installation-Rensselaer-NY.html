<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Rensselaer NY</h3>
<p>For the most part, the toilet can be fixed rather than replaced, since the concern typically comes down to a single component or two. Sometimes, however, the damage is so substantial that you either need to replace the whole toilet, or the cost of repairs is so large that replacement is simply a more useful option. This usually includes cracks in the toilet bowl itself, extensive corrosion over multiple parts, or merely since you  want to replace your existing toilet with something more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>To identify if your home is a poly house," begin with the outside. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in size.
