Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
