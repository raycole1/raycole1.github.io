<p>Wood pipes were used in London and in other places during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and avenues, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
