It's also important to replace lead pipes as soon as possible because of their unfavorable health effects as well as polybutylene pipes, which tend to leak.</p>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are installed in areas where water could trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
