<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Bunker Hill WV</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
