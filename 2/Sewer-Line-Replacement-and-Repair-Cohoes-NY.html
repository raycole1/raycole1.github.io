<p>Know that softened water includes trace quantities of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water consists of about the same quantity of salt as a slice of bread. That's not very much salt, but for those on a strict sodium-free diet it might be excessive. If this does not work, you might need to replace among your toilet's parts, typically the flapper. There might also be a concern with the chain attached to the flapper or the float ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
