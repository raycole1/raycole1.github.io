<p>The most efficient way to resolve hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>If you see rust only in your hot water, then examine the status of your water heater's anode rod. If you've never ever done this on your own, you might need a professional to do this.
