<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
