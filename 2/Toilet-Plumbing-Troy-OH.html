<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon for how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others.

They are generally sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new setups must have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
