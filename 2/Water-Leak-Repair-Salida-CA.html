<h3>How To Pick Good 24 Hour Emergency Plumbers For Pipe Video Inspections Salida CA</h3>
<p>Marin WATER is a professional plumbing and water treatment professional situated in San Rafael, CA. We proudly serve residential and commercial customers throughout Marin County, California. Does your water taste bad? Does it leave a milky residue on your components and counters? No matter what problems you're having with your faucet water, RainSoft has the perfect option.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
