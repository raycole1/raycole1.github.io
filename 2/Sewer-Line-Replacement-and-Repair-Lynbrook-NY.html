<p>Spotty dishes? Distribution pipes transition to even smaller sized private service pipes, bring water to specific houses, apartment or condo companies, structures and stores. Depending upon demand, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches.

Specific service pipelines are usually made from plastic, lead or Type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be critical.</p>

<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and in other places during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
