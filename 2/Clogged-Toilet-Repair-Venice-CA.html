<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Venice CA</h3>
<p>In many cases, the toilet can be repaired rather than replaced, since the problem typically comes down to a single element or two. In some cases, however, the damage is so extensive that you either need to replace the whole toilet, or the cost of repairs is so large that replacement is just a more useful alternative. This normally includes cracks in the toilet bowl itself, prevalent corrosion over several parts, or simply due to the fact that you  wish to replace your existing toilet with something more aesthetically pleasing.</p>

Local plumber quoted rate of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ pleased I inspected around.

To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
