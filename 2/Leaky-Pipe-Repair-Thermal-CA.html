<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be gotten rid of and replaced with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that only initial factory repair parts are used.

These two pieces have complementary grooves that when correctly fitted together hold the mount ring and disposal in place. Holding the install ring at the upper part of the flange, work the cushion install over the bottom of the flange, making certain that the rubber of the cushion install is completely and firmly locking into the groove on the bottom of the flange.
