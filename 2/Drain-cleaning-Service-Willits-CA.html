Channeling occurs when the inbound tough water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.

<p>Pretty little flappers may get all the glory in the toilet world, but the journey lever is the bridge between male and machine. After all, if the journey lever does not raise the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to wiggle and jiggle and in some cases even stick your hand in there and lift the flapper by hand. And who wants to do all that work??? In all seriousness however, making sure your journey lever is working well can conserve you the hassle of those small day-to-day troubles - that many people just live with and never realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water squandered every day by a bad seal.</p>
