<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Pleasanton CA</h3>
<p>We really care about our customers and the services that we provide. As hard water passes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with sodium ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this process, totally free" salt ions are launched into the water. The time between recharging cycles depends upon the hardness of the water, the amount of water utilized, the size of the unit and the capability of the exchange media to remove firmness.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that are subject to fouling, wear or tiredness. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be evaluated periodically to guarantee they are operating effectively. A visual check of air gaps suffices, but mechanical backflow preventers need to be evaluated with appropriately adjusted gauge equipment.</p>
