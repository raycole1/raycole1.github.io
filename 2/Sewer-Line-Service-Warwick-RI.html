<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Warwick RI</h3>

Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
