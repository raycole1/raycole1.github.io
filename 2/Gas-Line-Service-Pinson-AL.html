<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in numerous parts of the plumbing system, a lot of frequently in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow concerns or even stop a component from flowing entirely.

<p>If there is backflow at your house, you might infect your drinking water with non-treated water from an irrigation canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it. Likewise, if you use your hose to fill a wading pool or hot tub, a reversal of the water circulation might siphon pool or health spa chemicals back through the garden hose and into your house's plumbing.</p>
