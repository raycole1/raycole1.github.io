<p>However, you likewise need to think about the age of your system. If your system is getting close to 10 years old, it's generally not a good idea to pay for repairs if they deserve more than half of the cost of a brand-new unit.

It is our goal to offer all of our valued customers throughout Albuquerque and the surrounding locations the service they need at a rate they can pay for.</p>

I would draw the line at trying to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other specific models).
