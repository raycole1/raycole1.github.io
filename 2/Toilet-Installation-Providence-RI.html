<p>Covert water leaks are frequently difficult and have Potentially Serious Consequences. Replacing your flapper might require a little different steps than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, however possibilities are you'll find one of the exact same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>

And who wants to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, making certain your trip lever is working well can save you the trouble of those little everyday troubles - that the majority of people just live with and never ever understand they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to discuss the gallons of water squandered every day by a bad seal.</p>
