For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that speed up rust Likewise, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of rust control. Thus, considering all these aspects, as well as arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
