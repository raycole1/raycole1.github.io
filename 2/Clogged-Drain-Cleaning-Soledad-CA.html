<p>Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
