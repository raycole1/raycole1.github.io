<p>When the data collected from the field test shows the assembly has actually degraded in its efficiency below the developed minimum standard, backflow preventers need to just be fixed. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer.

These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
