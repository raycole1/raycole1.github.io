<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets need to absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet must be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>
<p>Water hardness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the distinction on your skin is because soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term solidity" came from ... it's tough to clean in.</p>
<p>Backpressure may take place when the drinkable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not appropriately protected, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system.</p>
