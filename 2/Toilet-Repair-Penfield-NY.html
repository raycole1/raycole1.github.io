<p>Back-siphonage is backflow caused by a negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a Public water system or customer's potable water supply.

<p>Read your insurance coverage policy thoroughly if your polybutylene pipes have actually failed. Make sure you understand what is covered and what is not covered.

Call your insurance representative and confirm your protection. When you have gone through your policy and verified what is covered and what is not covered, double check with your agent to confirm that your understanding is appropriate.</p>
<p>Inspect water or air test on system. Water test not less than the water working pressure of the system. Air test for piping systems aside from plastic, not less than 50 psi. The test shall be held for not less than 15 minutes without leaks.
