<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. If permitted to return to the supply of water, there is capacity for the contaminated water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
