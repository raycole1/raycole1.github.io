If sewage from the City-maintained portion of the sewer system backs up through toilets or sinks, call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700. City workers will check and get rid of clogs in the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line that the City is responsible for. If the problem is the outcome of too much storm water in the system, you may need to wait till the storm has actually decreased to have actually the backup solved.</p>
<p>When it comes to plumbing and maintenance, sewer video inspection is among the best methods to stay ahead of the video game.
