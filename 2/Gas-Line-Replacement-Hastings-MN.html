<p>The toilet takes an actually long time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout typical operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves-- described as the zone of minimized pressure-- is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve ought to leak, the relief valve is developed to release and open water to the outdoors, making sure backflow never ever occurs.</p>
