<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Mercersburg PA</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular event, but it does occur more often than you believe! Frequently it occurs at night when you don't observe the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
