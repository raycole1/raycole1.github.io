<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>

<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Milford OH</h3>

Thus, considering all these aspects, along with arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
