<p>The next action we must perform in the repair process, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have cleaned up the body, and the repaired parts are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be challenging, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be made use of to ensure the line is effectively flushed.</p>

In many cases, elimination will only add an extra $25 to $50 to the total costs, however in some cases the expenses might be higher if extra pipes must also be changed.</p>
