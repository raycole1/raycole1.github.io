Toilets also have a flapper seal made of rubber at the bottom of the tank that keeps the water in the tank until the toilet is flushed.  This seal weakens with time enabling water to escape into the toilet bowl, therefore minimizing the quantity of water in the tank offered for a flush.  It also has the disadvantage of increasing your water bill due to wastage of water.</p>
<p>A brand-new water heater will likely last longer, give you fewer problems, and cost you less to operate gradually.

In areas where it freezes, the backflow preventer need to be safeguarded from freezing. See the Irrigation System Winterization tutorial for details.</p>
