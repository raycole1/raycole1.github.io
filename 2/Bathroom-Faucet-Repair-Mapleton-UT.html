<p>The law also needs yearly testing and inspection by a certified tester, and a report sent to the DEP. Failure to comply can cause penalties and termination of water service. Due to the fact that backflow preventer devices are comprised of moving seals, parts, and springs and undergo corrosive compounds, wear, and fatigue, it's crucial to properly preserve them to guarantee they correctly run and play their part in keeping our city's drinking water safe.</p>
