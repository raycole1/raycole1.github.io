<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was clearly weakening; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
