<p>To prep your system for installation, you might need to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug kit that I purchased separately from the disposal unit.

<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regrowth usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
