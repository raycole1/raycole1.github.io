<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these problems.</p>
