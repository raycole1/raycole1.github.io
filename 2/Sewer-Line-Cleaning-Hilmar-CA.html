<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water.

Given that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
