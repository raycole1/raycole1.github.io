<p>Sound is normal, but when you see that the sounds are all there however food is not being ground up it is most likely that the motor has gone. Some sounds suggest the need for repairs or a great clean out, and you can offer the system an excellent check prior to starting to price new ones.

<p>Electric water heaters do have a couple of downsides however that are worth explaining. Most importantly, electrical power is not as cheap as gas. Some energy companies charge greater rates for electricity during peak periods such as really early in the early morning and in the evening.

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
