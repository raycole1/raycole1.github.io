<p>New homes built with copper pipes are especially susceptible to destructive water conditions since the copper pipes have not had a possibility to become covered inside. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a period of 3 to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Numerous new homes are built with PEX and not copper.</p>

Entire house filtration systems can get rid of chlorine and other damaging chemicals from all of your water sources and enhance your water taste, quality, and color for drinking, bathing, cleaning, and washing.

Job well done: You do not want to wind up with gunk and water all over your kitchen floor. Leaving the job to a certified plumber ensures a smooth installation process.</p>
