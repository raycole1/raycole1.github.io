Call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance staff at (503) 823-1700 if sewage from the City-maintained part of the sewer system backs up through sinks or toilets.

<p>Garbage disposal warranties last approximately 5 years, but they can range in between 2 and ten years.

A greater rating indicates better energy-efficiency and a lower operating expense. The quality of the water heater and the installation will influence the price of your new hot water heater.</p>
<p>If you resemble many people, you've never ever even thought of it, however flushing your water heater can help it last longer and could conserve you money on energy costs by restoring the efficiency of the water heater.

That means 8 fewer inches of hot water, not to point out the reality that your tap water is being heated in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuric‐smelling germs.</p>
