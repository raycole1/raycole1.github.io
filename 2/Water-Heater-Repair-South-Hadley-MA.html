<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion.

Because opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
