<p>Rust is an intricate phenomenon and there are lots of factors that accelerate rust in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that accelerate deterioration Likewise, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of deterioration control. Hence, thinking about all these aspects, in addition to arise from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
