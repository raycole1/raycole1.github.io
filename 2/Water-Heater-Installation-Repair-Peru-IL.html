An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a new pipe. This makes construction jobs quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>
