I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
