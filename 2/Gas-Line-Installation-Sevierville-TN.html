<h3>The Importance Of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Sevierville TN</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains substantial quantities of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its many desired uses around your house.</p>
<p>Badly set up gas lines result in gas leaks. Gas leakages are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself project. The gas lines have to be calibrated to the right levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a home, beside heating & cooling. The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>
<p>Softeners mainly remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently described as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they must be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a substantial warning that something more serious is incorrect with them.</p>
<p>Malfunctioning drains are more than troublesome. They can be a smelly health risk that causes waste to support into your home. Benjamin Franklin Plumbing believes the best way to avoid drain problems is through prevention, both with professional installation and regular maintenance. Even if a professional group didn't install your drains, we're here to help with a full series of drain repair and maintenance services.</p>
