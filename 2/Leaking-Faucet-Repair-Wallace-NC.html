Compare their expenses with what you can find online or at home enhancement stores if you need a new sink or faucet. They may be getting you a much better offer</p>
<p>Push the pointer of a screwdriver up against the edge of the plug and tap up until you break out the plug. Then remove this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can most likely hold the system upside down and shake it out). There are different types and designs of sink faucets, and your Good Guy plumber knows how to repair them all, and can likewise use installation of a brand-new faucet if needed.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and determine the reason for the problem. The line was plainly deteriorating; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line could collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
