<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>
