<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply.

Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
