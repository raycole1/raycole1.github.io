So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers deal with all kinds of work. Their tasks break out into 2 categories: Plumbers who handle fundamental repairs (often in emergency situations), and plumbers who concentrate on remodeling additions and tasks.</p>
