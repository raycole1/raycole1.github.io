Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its lots of desired usages around your home.</p>
