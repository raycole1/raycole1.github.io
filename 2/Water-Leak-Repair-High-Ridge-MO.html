<p>The most reliable way to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The sewer line in your house is a huge part of your house's plumbing. Your sewer line becomes part of your water supply that carries out all water and waste from your sinks, drains, and toilets.
