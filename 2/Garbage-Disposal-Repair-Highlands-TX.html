But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of home centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more.
