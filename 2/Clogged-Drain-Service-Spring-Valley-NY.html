<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a serious public health risk if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of sickness or disease.</p>
<p>We provide quickly, same day service and will send out a skilled professional to your home or business and do our best to guarantee that you have warm water again as rapidly as possible. Gurgling sounds from a toilet are caused by air in the drain and ventilation system. A blocked toilet drain or vent line is the root concern. This requires a plumber to fix, however fortunately is that your toilet probably doesn't need to be changed.</p>
<p>Hydro-jetting is an effective way to totally clear your main sewer line. The majority of people typically refer to rooting as drain cleaning, however, this is not entirely accurate. Rootering a line with a drain machine breaks through a clog triggering a backup. Hydro-jetting is a different type of service to completely clean the drain line.</p>
