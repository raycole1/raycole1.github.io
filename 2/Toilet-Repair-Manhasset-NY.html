You might wind up doing more harm than excellent if you continue to fight with it, which can develop permanent problems.

It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. A PVB might be used to isolate health or non-health dangers but is effective versus back-siphonage only.</p>
