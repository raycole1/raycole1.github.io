For the more serious clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>
<p>It's a great idea to have a professional evaluate your drain system if you experience blockages and backups in your house more than a few times. A drain expert like TLC will use a camera to check your drain system. Often, if you have several drain problems you might have a drain line break somewhere in your home or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can find and determine the problem so the drain can be fixed.</p>
<p>Even if you believe you can handle it by yourself, you most likely don't have a camera appropriate for diagnosing the reason for blockage around bends in your pipes.
