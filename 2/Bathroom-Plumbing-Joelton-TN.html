<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>You'll notice that water runs to refill the bowl Whenever you flush your toilet. Nevertheless, in a correctly working toilet, the water should stop running once the bowl is filled to its proper capability. Possibilities are you have an internal leak and water is being dumped down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leaks are very wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up traveling through the overflow.</p>
