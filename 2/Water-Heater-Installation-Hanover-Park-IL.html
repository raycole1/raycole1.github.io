Softening your water down to the ideal level of 6 grains of hardness is perfect for household use due to the fact that the water remains less destructive than over-softened water and is devoid of scale producing solidity. Since gas lines run from your house to the outdoor area of your property if there is a damaged gas line outside of the house you will see damaged greenery and condensation on the windows nearby to the damaged plumbing.</p>

Discolored water suggests rust in your pipes or water heater. If your water is an unusual color, this warrants professional attention.

You may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one if so. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
