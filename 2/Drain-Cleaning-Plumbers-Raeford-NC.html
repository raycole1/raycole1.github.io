<p>In municipal water system systems, water is generally preserved at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to flow to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your home or company. When the pressure drops for some factor such as may happen when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to fight a fire or a water main breaks or some other situation happens, infected water may be drawn into the system. To avoid such an event, there requires to be some type of backflow prevention technique used.
