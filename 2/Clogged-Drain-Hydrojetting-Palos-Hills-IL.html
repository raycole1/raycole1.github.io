<p>Aside from these two important parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less vital things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.

Tank hot water heater are typically discovered in a lot of houses. Their elements are an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water up until it's needed.
