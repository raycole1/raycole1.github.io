<p>Pipefitters and steamfitters, in some cases just called fitters, install and maintain pipes that may carry acids, gases, and chemicals. These pipes are mostly in production, commercial, and industrial settings. Fitters install and repair pipe systems in power plants, as well as heating and cooling systems in big office buildings. Steamfitters concentrate on systems that are created for the circulation of liquids or gases at high pressure. Other fitters may specialize as sprinklerfitters or gasfitters.</p>
<p>Just like other building employees, work of steamfitters, pipefitters, and plumbers is sensitive to variations in the economy. On the one hand, workers may experience periods of unemployment when the total level of construction falls. On the other hand, scarcities of employees may occur in some locations throughout peak periods of structure activity.</p>
