<p>So, if you wish to stop having to jiggle your toilet manage each time you flush and are sick and tired of publishing courteous check in your bathroom everytime you have people over, get a new trip lever that in fact works for your toilet. While particular specialized flush valves or flappers may require a particular trip lever to work appropriately, most toilets will work just fine with a "will fit" lever - which is excellent news for people who can't find their design number or who perhaps have redesigned or upgraded their components and desire a different finish or style deal with to match the rest of their bathroom decoration.</p>
