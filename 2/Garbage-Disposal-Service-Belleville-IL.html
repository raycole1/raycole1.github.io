<p>The most efficient way to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>To plumb the disposer's drain outlet, fit the rubber washer over the flanged end of the plastic crosspiece, then slide the metal flange on from the other end. Tip the bottom of the metal flange into its slot in the disposer and tighten up the securing bolt through the top of the flange.
