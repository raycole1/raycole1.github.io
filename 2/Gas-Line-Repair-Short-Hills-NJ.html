<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our market and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
