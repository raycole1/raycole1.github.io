A permit and inspections are required for most residential projects consisting of patios, additions, and devices such as air conditioning system and hot water heater.

Bottom line: Hard water can make cosmetic and domestic cleaning products less reliable. This can lead to irritated skin and even a broken washing machine. It's why many cleaning products today contain chelating representatives or other kinds of water softeners.</p>
<p>In many cases, when you have a clogged drain or toilet, an auger is used to unclog the pipe and remove the debris. Depending upon the severity of the clog, or how far into your sewer pipe the clog is located, a high powered auger may be required. Parker & Sons Plumbing values the security and security of all of our consumers, so our plumbers are all highly-trained and guaranteed to ensure you get safe and quality service.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is common in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
