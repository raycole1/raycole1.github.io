<p>Like any household appliance, hot water heater require routine maintenance to operate securely and effectively. Regular water heater maintenance can also extend the life of the device and help avoid other problems or unforeseen leaks.

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
