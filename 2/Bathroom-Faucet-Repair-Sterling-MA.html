However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular event, but it does happen more often than you believe! Frequently it happens during the night when you do not see the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a new pipe. This makes building jobs easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical cause of backflow. Fire engine use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>
