<p>As discussed previously in the article, carbon monoxide gas is colorless and totally odorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every house needs to have carbon monoxide detectors installed at the appropriate locations. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are usually sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new setups should have a 10-year non-serviceable kind of detector.</p>
<p>The system has gone back to an absolutely no need condition (no valves open downstream). However, particles between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the elements, is preventing the # 1 Check from closing all the way. This enables pressure to adjust between the Supply Side and the Zone of Minimized Pressure. When this occurs, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
