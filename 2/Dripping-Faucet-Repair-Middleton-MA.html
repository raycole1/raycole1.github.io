<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe at Middleton MA</h3>

<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might have to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug kit that I purchased individually from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
