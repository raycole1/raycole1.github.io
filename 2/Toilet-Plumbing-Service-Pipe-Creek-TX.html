<p>In many cases, the toilet can be repaired instead of replaced, since the issue frequently comes down to a single part or two. Sometimes, however, the damage is so comprehensive that you either need to replace the entire toilet, or the cost of repairs is so big that replacement is merely a more practical option. This typically involves fractures in the toilet bowl itself, extensive rust over numerous parts, or just due to the fact that you  want to replace your existing toilet with something more visually pleasing.</p>
<p>Mixing vaporized salt with rock salt is not advised, as this might clog the softening reservoir. It is recommended that you allow your system to go empty of one type of salt before adding another to avoid the occurrence of any problems. In any case, when you're preparing a water heater replacement, play it safe. Call your local department of inspections and ask if you need an authorization. And ensure a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
