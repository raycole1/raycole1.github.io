<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is normal in our market and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
