<p>A lot of residential homes have roof rain gutters that stream into downspout drains that direct water far from your home. When those downspouts are linked to underground drains that flow to community storm drains or street seamless gutters, they sometimes end up being clogged with tree roots and particles. These kinds of blockages trigger rain gutters to overflow and the weight of the water can cause seamless gutters to retreat from a house while inflicting water damage and rot to the structure. Please note that Roto-Rooter does not clean roofing system rain gutters or rectangle-shaped aluminum gutter downspouts.</p>
