<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Springtown TX</h3>
<p>To replace a gas and repair line expect to pay $ 120 to $1,300. Repairing a gas line is really replacing a gas line - if it's malfunctioning it needs to be replaced.

<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
