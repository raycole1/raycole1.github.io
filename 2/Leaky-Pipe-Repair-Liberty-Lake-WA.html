<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the required instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. If enabled to return to the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
