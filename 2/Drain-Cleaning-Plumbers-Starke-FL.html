<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather protection. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Traditional tank-type water heaters consist of steel cylinders that are fed by a pipes that dips into a big storage tank. The water inside this tank is heated up and then launched into the pipes of your house through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank consists of the temperature and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you exceed a pre-programmed level. You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperature levels and managing the pilot-light valve.</p>
