<p>In some cases you understand you have a sewer line break because you can smell foul odors or you have a sewage back-up in your house. It is important to identify the exact location of the break in your sewer line. Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and understanding this can save you thousands of dollars in repairs. Merely sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can resolve the problem. The service technicians and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you always have a copy for your insurance coverage city, real estate agent or company inspector.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and performs regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report must be provided to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in tough water can cause a bad smell and taste. It removes the mineral content to produce odor free drinking water that tastes great when you add a water softener.</p>
