You'll need to take apart the drainpipe and P-trap that runs underneath the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that travels behind the cabinet wall. This is where you place the snake into the pipe till you feel resistance to break up the clog.</p>
<p>If you decide to leave a cracked sink unrepaired, keep in mind that fractures can increase and lead to leaking, which heightens mold growth.
