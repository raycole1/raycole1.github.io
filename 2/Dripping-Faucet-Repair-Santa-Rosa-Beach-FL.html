<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet.

The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of lawn sprinkler includes the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves.
