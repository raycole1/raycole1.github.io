<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain appropriately or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. In some cases drain repair requirements can be resolved fairly quickly by a skilled handyman. At other times, however, portions of a drain may need to be disassembled, examined, and cleared before being changed. In many cases, a handyman may identify that a replacement part is required (like a pvc, tailpiece, or reducer  trap) to ensure regular operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman representative today to talk about repair options.</p>

<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Westminster MA</h3>
<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be discovered near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Warning: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall. Just because copper is revealing does not indicate you do not have polybutylene pipes. You might have to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>Garbage disposals are an essential feature in any modern kitchen. If you reside in an older home, your sink may not have one, requiring you to be diligent about keeping food scraps from streaming down the drain. It's also possible for a disposal to unexpectedly break, bringing cooking or clean-up to a grinding stop. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per linear foot. Copper pipes are environmentally friendly and are resistant to splitting. Nevertheless, they're also the most pricey in this list and in areas with hard water (like Florida) they can establish pinhole leaks.</p>
<p>In most cases, when you have a clogged drain or toilet, an auger is used to unclog the pipe and eliminate the particles. Depending on the severity of the clog, or how far into your sewer pipe the clog is located, a high powered auger may be required.
