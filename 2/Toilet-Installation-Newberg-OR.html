Thankfully, you can call the professionals at Cooper's Plumbing & Air for quick waste disposal unit repair, in addition to all your kitchen plumbing needs.</p>

For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, decreased or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
