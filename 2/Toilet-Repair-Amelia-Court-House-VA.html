If the water level is below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to drip into the bowl. That slow, continuous outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing totally. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water stains and corrosion. However don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>

<p>Leakages can occur if the seal between the tank and bowl stops working, or the seal at the floor drain stops working.

<p>Learn if there are any lead pipes in the house. Homes that were developed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how helpful, is an ecological contaminant (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have kids, you may not want to reside in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
