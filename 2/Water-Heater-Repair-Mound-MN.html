Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
