<p>Due to the fact that of the fundamental design of a decreased pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on a very low circulation or static flow condition may cause annoyance dripping and prospective fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
<p>After getting here after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together however declared they would not take responsibility if it dripped now because of some unspecified oddities in how my sink was put together. After they provided me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, since I never ever wish to see this company again.</p>
