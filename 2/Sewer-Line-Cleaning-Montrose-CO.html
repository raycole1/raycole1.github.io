<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will ultimately take its toll. If you see that your plumbing experiences various clogs, leakages, and water pressure variation that no quantity of repairs appears to stem, you must speak with a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as an option.

<p>Electric hot water heater do have a couple of drawbacks nevertheless that deserve mentioning. First and foremost, electrical power is not as cheap as gas. Some utility companies charge greater rates for electrical energy during peak durations such as very early in the early morning and in the evening. Utilizing your heater during these peak durations can increase your power costs. On the hand, gas is inexpensive and has a set rate. Another drawback of an electrical hot water heater is that they can be expensive to install, particularly when it pertains to whole-house tankless systems.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and performs regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be supplied to the City of Bellingham.
