Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content.

More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
