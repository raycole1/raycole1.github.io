<p>Since the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to become layered within, New homes built with copper pipes are especially prone to destructive water conditions. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new home for a duration of 3 to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
