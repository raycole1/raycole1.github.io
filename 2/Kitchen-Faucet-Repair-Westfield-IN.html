Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>The watering backflow testing season is from May to September. Watering backflow prevention assemblies must be evaluated by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to ensure proper backflow prevention is in place to safeguard our drinking water during the irrigation season.
