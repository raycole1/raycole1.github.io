<p>Noise is typical, but when you notice that the sounds are all there however food is not being ground up it is likely that the motor has gone. Some sounds indicate the need for repairs or a great clean out, and you can offer the system a great check prior to starting to price new ones. However if your disposal is old enough, repairs will cost you cash for really little future usage.</p>
<p>The system has actually gone back to an absolutely no demand condition (no valves open downstream). However, debris in between the # 1 Inspect Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the components, is avoiding the # 1 Inspect from closing all the way. This permits pressure to match in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Decreased Pressure. When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
