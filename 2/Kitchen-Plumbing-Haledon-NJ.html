<p>Other pipe repair methods include our Pipe Pull technique and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull technique interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into location. All new replacement pipes have a predicted life-span of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another efficient method is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically eliminates the need for broken pipe removal. By inserting a hardening lining material which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a brand-new pipe is developed inside the broken one.</p>

<p>IRWD is devoted to delivering safe, high quality water to customers. Our substantial water quality program runs 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our consumers is kept free from hazardous contaminants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment consisting of a nonpotable substance, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination may happen when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating and cooling system, into the drinkable water supply. This can take place through a process known as backflow.</p>
<p>Release piping linked to a storm sewer will be equipped with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for instance, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices recommends a DCV assembly on wet or dry sprinkler systems unless there is a risk of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>
