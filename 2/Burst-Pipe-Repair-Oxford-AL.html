<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
