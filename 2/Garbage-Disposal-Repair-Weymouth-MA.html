Water pressure might be or fail minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
