<p>Surprise water leakages are typically difficult and have Potentially Major Consequences. Replacing your flapper may require somewhat different actions than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To find a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, but chances are you'll find one of the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
<p>You wish to save water. Older toilets consume to seven gallons of water per flush and are much less water-efficient than newer models.

<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were prompt and extremely responsive to send me a bid which was extremely competitive. They were very professional and did a remarkable task. I would absolutely call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this staining only appears when hot water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still an issue that needs to be handled right away (you'll likely need a brand-new water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
