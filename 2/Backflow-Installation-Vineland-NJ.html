<p>Deterioration is a complicated phenomenon and there are many elements that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that accelerate deterioration Also, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of deterioration control. Hence, thinking about all these elements, along with results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General.

If so preferred, this will not prevent the licensee from getting permits and inspections for such work.</p>

<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capability and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean.

Regrowth automatically starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regeneration normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
