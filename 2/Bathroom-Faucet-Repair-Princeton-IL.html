<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>All devices or systems supplied by potable water lines that may be subject to contamination must have airgaps (Ct. Regs. ยง 19-13-38a( b )).
