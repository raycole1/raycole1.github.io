<p>Sewer lines can fail for a variety of factors, including poor soil conditions, blockages from grease and gunk, and corrosion. Even trees and bushes can cause problems for sewer lines, particularly in older neighborhoods where clay pipe might have been used. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as compounded if pipes have actually been allowed to freeze.</p>
<p>Other pipe repair strategies include our Pipe Pull strategy and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull method interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with new piping by the usage of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into location. All new replacement pipes have a predicted lifespan of one hundred years and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another efficient technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially gets rid of the need for broken pipe elimination. By placing a solidifying lining product which coats the within the existing pipe, a new pipe is produced inside the broken one.</p>
