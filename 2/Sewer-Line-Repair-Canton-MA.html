<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET used by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.

Appropriate care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its guarantee and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
