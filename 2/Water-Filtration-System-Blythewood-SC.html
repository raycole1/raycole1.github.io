<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, however prevents it from reversing in the opposite direction. For over 25 years, homeowners and entrepreneur have actually trusted Good's Plumbing Heating & Air Cooling for their sewer cleaning and water heater replacement needs. Outdoors obstructions - Heavy rains can quickly result in a need for drain cleaning. Outdoors drains are usually not developed to deal with big volumes of water, and can quickly become stopped up due to particles such as dirt and leaves.</p>
<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and bacteria from becoming a problem in your water system by sending out an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system. The signal causes the minerals to collaborate, forming clusters that eventually form steady crystals. These crystals do not hold on to surface areas like individual minerals would.</p>

<p>In many cases, our service technicians will recommend that you replace your water heater rather than purchase repairs. This is typically the case when the water heater is more than ten years old or the cost of repairs would total more than half the cost of an entire brand-new unit. In some cases a bothersome toilet simply needs a minor change and life is back to regular. That is why we offer a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) carry out a dye test.</p>

Disposers can be dropped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, as well as the typical kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, searching pads and twist-ties. While some older houses may not have backflow preventers, all newer homes are needed to have them. Doug's can help you find and determine them if you're not sure what kind of backflow preventers are used in your home or service. We can also perform your yearly backflow inspections.</p>
