No, it is not a regular occurrence, however it does take place regularly than you think! Frequently it occurs during the night when you don't see the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
