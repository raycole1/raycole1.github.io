<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the offender. But not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause difficulty too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
