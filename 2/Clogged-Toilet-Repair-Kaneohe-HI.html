<p>Many houses or structures that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the external coating of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>

If you're not comfy making electrical connections for your waste disposal unit installation, you can purchase a disposal that currently has a cord attached.
