This is specifically true if you have without treatment hard water, which includes extreme minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the product over time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another element that is triggering the deterioration, you will eventually experience a leak in your hot water heater that is hard to repair. Leaks frequently indicate a new unit replacement is in order.</p>
<p>All backflow preventers need to be evaluated every year and after repair, relocation, or replacement by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester (BAT).

Depending on your needs, you may need more than one tankless water heater to fulfill your daily warm water demands.</p>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and avoid it from working. This is referred to as fouling.
