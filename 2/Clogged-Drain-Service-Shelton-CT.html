<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is common in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
