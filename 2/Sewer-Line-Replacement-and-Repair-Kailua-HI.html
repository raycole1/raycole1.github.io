<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing regular and major leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can actually be the less expensive and much better long-lasting service if you do have regular leaks.</p>
