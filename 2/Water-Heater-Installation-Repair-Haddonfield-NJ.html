<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material. Some disposer units do not come with a power cord connected. If this is the case, get rid of the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1). Make certain to buy an electrical wiring package with the proper power ranking and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). Ensure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cable when you connect the electrical wiring harness to the disposer.</p>
