<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these small deposits are harmless, however in time they develop and ultimately clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

Before you can ask for an inspection, you must initially get the required permit( s) for the work you intend to do. You can check out our Permit page for additional information on getting a permit. As soon as you obtain an authorization you can begin with the work. However, you must call for inspection before you hide any work or cover.</p>
<p>The key to the technology is being able to manage both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby getting rid of hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
