<p>Seattle Public Utilities needs that any cross connection have a backflow preventer.

<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Cost Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were timely and extremely responsive to send me a quote which was extremely competitive. They were extremely professional and did an incredible task. I would absolutely call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration only appears when warm water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still a problem that needs to be handled right now (you'll likely need a brand-new water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
