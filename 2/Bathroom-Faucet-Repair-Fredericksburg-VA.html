<p>Frequent leakages: Leaks coming from your water heater are never a good sign. If your water heater has regular leaks or is constantly needing repairs, it is likely more economical to replace the entire unit. A backflow preventer is a device that's installed on your home's pipes that enables water to flow in one instructions but never ever in the opposite direction. Its sole job is to prevent drinking water from being infected due to backflow.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a short-term fix. It's a long-term service for the whole plumbing system in your house or service. We turn off the water system, eliminate old pipe and replace it with new pipe. After the brand-new system is set up, we turn the water on and perform tests on the new system. Once the system passes our tests, it's good to choose you.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and performs regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report should be offered to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste better. The minerals in hard water can trigger a bad smell and taste. It gets rid of the mineral content to produce odor free drinking water that tastes great when you include a water softener.</p>
