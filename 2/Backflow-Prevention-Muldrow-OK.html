Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

When this occurs, the Relief Valve Spring presses back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
