<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. A license is not required for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or components. A common water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell.</p>

Derek snaked the laundry line and outdoors kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He was able to get a snake around the "Y", which lots of plumbers say they can't do, and clear the line.
