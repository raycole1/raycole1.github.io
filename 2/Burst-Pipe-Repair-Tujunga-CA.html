<p>Other than water dripping and the occasional creak, your pipes ought to not be making any odd sounds, specifically not ones loud enough to keep you up during the night. If your pipes are rattling, clanking, banging or making other obnoxious sounds, that's a surefire sign of a larger issue. Have your pipes examined as soon as possible so you don't end up with a major leak.</p>
<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your unit is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position prior to you plug the new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal launch while your head is pressed versus it will lead to decapitation, it may scare a couple of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience.</p>

After they gave me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, because I never wish to see this company again.</p>
