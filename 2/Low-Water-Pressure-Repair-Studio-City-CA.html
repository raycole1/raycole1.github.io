<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>To determine if your house is a poly house," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be gray or black).
