<p>When the end user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the typical instructions from the supplier, downstream to fill the user's need. The circulation of water pushes the spring-loaded check valves open. The tension of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure difference in the Zone of Lowered Pressure. This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water flows in the typical instructions.</p>
<p>The system has returned to a zero need condition (no valves open downstream). However, particles in between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the components, is preventing the # 1 Examine from closing all the way. This permits pressure to equalize between the Supply Side and the Zone of Lowered Pressure. When this occurs, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
