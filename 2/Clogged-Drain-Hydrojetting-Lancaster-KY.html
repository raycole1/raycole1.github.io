At Passaic Bergen Water Softening, task # 1 is to make it much easier and easier for you to make wise, informed decisions about the quality of your water and how to correct it if required.</p>
<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening just removes hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
