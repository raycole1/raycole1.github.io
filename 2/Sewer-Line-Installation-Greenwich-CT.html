<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services Greenwich CT</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular event, but it does occur regularly than you believe! Typically it takes place during the night when you don't observe the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a new pipe. This makes building tasks easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine utilize huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>
