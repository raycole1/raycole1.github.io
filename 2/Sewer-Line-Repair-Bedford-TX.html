For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>The drain valve (Image 2) on old water heaters frequently congests. Be patient if the water drains slowly. CARE: It's scalding hot!

Consumer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a price quote from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of the businesses we called would offer an estimate over the phone. All of them wished to look at the situation prior to devoting to a price, and all wanted to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks found just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>

<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Bedford TX</h3>
<p>In many cases, the toilet can be repaired rather than replaced, because the problem often comes down to a single element or 2. Often, however, the damage is so extensive that you either need to replace the whole toilet, or the cost of repairs is so large that replacement is just a more practical option. This normally includes fractures in the toilet bowl itself, extensive rust over several parts, or merely because you 'd like to replace your existing toilet with something more visually pleasing.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Cost Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were prompt and very responsive to send me a quote which was extremely competitive. They were very professional and did an awesome job. I would certainly call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust most likely exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still an issue that needs to be handled right now (you'll likely need a brand-new water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
