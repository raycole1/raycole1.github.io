Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
