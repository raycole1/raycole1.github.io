<p>Clamp the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the depleted salt water service after the regeneration cycle. Clamp the drain hose securely and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain pipes must have an air gap. The end of the hose be at least 2 inches above the devoted drain. An air space might be used to accomplish this, and might be required depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>
