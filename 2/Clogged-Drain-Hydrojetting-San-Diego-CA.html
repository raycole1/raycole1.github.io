<p>Sinkholes don't just happen in your yard, unfortunately, when a sewer line breaks.

Claims may be rejected due to the fact that the standard HO-3 property owners' policy specifically excludes "a loss as the result of a water leak over a prolonged time period."

<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that manages water circulation in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't installed effectively, you may experience a frequently or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
