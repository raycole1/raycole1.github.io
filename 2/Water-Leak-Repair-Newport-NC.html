<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
