Depending upon demand, these pipes range in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches. Water gets in the customer facility via a water meter that tape-records circulation rates and water usage for billing purposes. Private service pipelines are normally made from lead, plastic or type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be important.</p>

A gas heater also requires a bit more to properly maintain over the years than an electrical heater will. In the end, the costs conserved for many years will more than cover the costs of water for a bigger family. Smaller individuals and families may do much better with an electric hot water heater, or an on-demand tankless" water heater as explained in the section below.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with.
