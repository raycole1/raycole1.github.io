<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
