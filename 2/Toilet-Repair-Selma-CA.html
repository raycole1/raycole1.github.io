<p>This is the traditional question that numerous house owners ask themselves. Is it better to repair their pipes or repipe them and start fresh? The response is totally based on your unique situation. For instance, if your pipe is experiencing a little leak but is in otherwise excellent condition, we would advise repairing it. Nevertheless, if the pipe is continuously leaking and requires regular repairs, we would suggest repiping. At Super Plumbers, we never ever advise services or products that would not genuinely benefit the client.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical compound that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water instead of developing on surfaces. However, if they remain in one location for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the buildup could still happen.</p>
