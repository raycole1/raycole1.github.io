<p>To figure out which toilet valve is causing the trouble, look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to drip into the bowl. That slow, continuous outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water spots and rust.
