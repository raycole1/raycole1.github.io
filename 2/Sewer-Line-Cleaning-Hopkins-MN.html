<p>Some producers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Through experience we know that a lot of softener resins and ion exchanger resins last about twenty to twenty-five years. Need a toilet bowl replacement? We can deal with that, too.
