<p>The next step we should perform in the repair procedure, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the repaired components are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system needs to be utilized to ensure the line is appropriately flushed.</p>

The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended.
