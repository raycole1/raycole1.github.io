<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that manages water circulation in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't installed correctly, you may experience an often or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>

<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. If enabled to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, in addition to inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
