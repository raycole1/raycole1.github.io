<p>Root Invasion: Root invasion describes what happens when tree roots begin to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This occurs because the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can trigger obstructions, breaks, and back-ups which might result in comprehensive home damage. Look out for wet, green patches in your lawn, a persistent sewage smell in or around your house, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and sluggish drains, as these are all common indications of root invasion.</p>
<p>If you see rust just in your hot water, then inspect the status of your water heater's anode rod. You might need a professional to do this if you've never done this on your own. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is most likely originating from the inside of your hot water heater. If this is the case, replace your water heater as quickly as possible. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your hot and cold water taps, you most likely have actually worn away piping.</p>
