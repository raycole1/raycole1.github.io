You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
