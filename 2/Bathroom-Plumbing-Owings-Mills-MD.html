<p>New homes developed with copper pipes are particularly vulnerable to destructive water conditions since the copper pipes have not had a chance to end up being covered within. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a period of three to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>

<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has space to hold on to positive ions. The fresh media begins by holding on to the weaker charged salt ions. As difficult water travels through your water softener tank, the more powerful charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Considering that the solidity minerals have a greater favorable charge than the sodium, they will knock the salt ions off and take their place.</p>
<p>We use both metal and plastic pipes in our repiping procedure. Since it is long lasting and resilient, copper is the industry requirement. We will offer you various options based upon your budget plan and preferences. PEX piping is a new option that is versatile, resistant to corrosion, and approximately 75 percent more economical than copper piping.</p>
