<p>Daily use should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also take place if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the unit in a stable and safe area.

When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water.
