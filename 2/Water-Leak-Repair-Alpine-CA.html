Before going into how to repair a toilet, it would benefit to comprehend how a toilet works.  Most houses in the United States, including Tampa Bay Area, have what is described as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets also have a flapper seal made from rubber at the bottom of the cistern that keeps the water in the tank up until the toilet is flushed.  This seal weakens with time allowing water to leave into the toilet bowl, therefore lowering the quantity of water in the tank available for a flush.  It likewise has the disadvantage of increasing your water costs due to wastage of water.</p>
