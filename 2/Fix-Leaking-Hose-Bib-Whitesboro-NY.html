<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board advises the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections concerning the administration of Post 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, consisting of licensing. Backsiphonage happens when there is a negative pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a private water supply into the public water system.

<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
