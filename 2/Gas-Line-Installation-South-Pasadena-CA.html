<p>. Backflow into a public water supply can contaminate or infect the water in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water system can make the water in that system unusable or risky to drink), and each water provider has a responsibility to offer water that is usable and safe to consume under all foreseeable situations. Furthermore, consumers generally have outright faith that water delivered to them through a public water supply is constantly safe to consume. For these reasons, your water district must take preventative measures to safeguard its public water system versus backflow.</p>
<p>Garbage disposals are a vital feature in any contemporary kitchen. If you live in an older home, your sink may not have one, forcing you to be thorough about keeping food scraps from streaming down the drain.

If these connections are not effectively safeguarded, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
