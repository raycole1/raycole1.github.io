<p>New homes developed with copper pipes are specifically susceptible to destructive water conditions because the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to end up being covered inside. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a duration of 3 to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Many brand-new homes are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>

<p>Backflow implies the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

<p>Backflow threatens due to the fact that it can contaminate the public drinking supply with contaminants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and hazardous chemicals. In 2010, for instance, students at a Bowling Green, Kentucky grade school suffered nausea and other symptoms after a contractor working on the HVAC system triggered the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
