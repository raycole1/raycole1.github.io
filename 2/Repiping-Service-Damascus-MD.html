<p>Backflow preventers are vital for developing a safe water supply system. No matter which design you select, all water softeners need to be effectively maintained. The brine solution must be blended and saved in the brine tank. Periodic clogging of the resin likewise needs special attention. For example, if the raw supply of water is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Often, regular backwashing with water will solve this issue.
