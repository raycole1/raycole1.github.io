<p>Back-siphonage is backflow caused by an unfavorable pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a Public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply.

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
