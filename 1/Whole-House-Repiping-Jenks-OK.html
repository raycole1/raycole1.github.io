<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system must be constantly kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
