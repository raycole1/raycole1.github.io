<p>When choosing the appropriate system defense there are several considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all situations in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be looked at on a private basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of lawn sprinkler includes the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire protection system are created to match the threat that exists in the places they are set up in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be very various, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation needs to be developed and set up to fulfill that particular threat or need. An aircraft garage will need a very various fire protection system than the system needed in an apartment. The backflow protection requirements for these 2 examples would also vary considerably.</p>
