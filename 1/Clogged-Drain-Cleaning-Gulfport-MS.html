<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc designed and constructed a smaller model that ran on the exact same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also constructed a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
<p>Softeners generally get rid of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are often referred to as 'hardness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they must be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a huge warning that something more serious is incorrect with them.</p>
