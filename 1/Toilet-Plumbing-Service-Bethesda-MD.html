<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and in other places throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively utilized in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from short lengths of wood.
