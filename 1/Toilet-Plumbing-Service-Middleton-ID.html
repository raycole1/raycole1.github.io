For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that speed up corrosion Also, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of rust control. Therefore, thinking about all these elements, as well as arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
