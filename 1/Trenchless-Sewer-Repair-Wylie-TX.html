<p>The drains in the typical house get consistent usage. Hair, food scraps, soap residue, and other particles can slowly build up in time.

In essence, it heats up the water as needed with just the amount you need, therefore eliminating the loss sustained with using storage tank water heaters where the water cools and is then reheated.</p>
