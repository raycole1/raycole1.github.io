<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and after that flush with hot water to clear the mixture.</p>
