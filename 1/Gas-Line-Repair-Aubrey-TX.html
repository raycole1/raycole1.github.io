When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to press the waste out of your drain system. Existing regulations restrict the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines.

Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it may need additional adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to work with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
