<p>One of the most common bathroom plumbing problems to occur is a clogged toilet. In fact, much of us keep a plunger near our toilet in case it ever should clog.

We suggest that you call in one of our professional plumbers to help you unclog your toilet when this occurs.</p>
<p>The Final Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't installed effectively, you may experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in squandered water.</p>
