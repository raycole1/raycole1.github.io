If any hard areas remain, we redo the job at no additional cost to you. We had some family coming to stay for graduation weekend and we needed a brand-new hot water heater prior to they got here. We searched for a bit, but we got the very best quotes from Blue Frog. They had the ability to send somebody out within a day or two. He was great and very friendly. He stated our bills must be lower now too.</p>
