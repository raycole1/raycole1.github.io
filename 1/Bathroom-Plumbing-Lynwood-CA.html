<p>Every reasonable buyer checks a minimum of numerous things prior to making a down payment on a house.

<p>Rust: The most typical issue is rust in the tank and pipes that link to your hot water heater. This is particularly true if you have untreated difficult water, which contains harsh minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the product over time.

Leakages often mean a new system replacement remains in order.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that are subject to fouling, use or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. Therefore, all backflow preventers have to be tested occasionally to ensure they are operating properly. A visual check of air spaces suffices, however mechanical backflow preventers have to be tested with appropriately adjusted gauge devices.</p>
