A permit is not needed for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages offered changes are not made in the existing piping or components. A normal water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell.</p>

The fundamental methods of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The standard mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
