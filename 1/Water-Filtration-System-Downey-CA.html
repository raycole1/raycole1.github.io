After they provided me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, given that I never ever wish to see this company again.</p>
<p>The average plumber's hourly wage is $68-$ 138. Many times simple repairs, such as unclogging a toilet or a drain, will have a repaired rate of about $220 unless there are extenuating circumstances. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a cost to look at your scenario and inform you what needs to be done, but if you employ them, that charge will be subtracted from the costs. A plumber may charge $50-$ 100 to diagnose the issue and come. 2 Needing to call a plumber after hours, on the weekend, or on a holiday will cost more.</p>
