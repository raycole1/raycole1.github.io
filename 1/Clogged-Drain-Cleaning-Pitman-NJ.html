<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is typical in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
