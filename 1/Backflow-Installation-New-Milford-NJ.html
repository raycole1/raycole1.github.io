<p>Electric hot water heater have a much shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of similar quality and capacity.

<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most widespread and destructive water problems: hard water.  Hard water ruined the modern-day house. Scale builds up in your pipes, clogging them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale significantly reduces the life-span of home appliances like dishwashers, coffee machine and ice devices. Hard water damages hot water home appliances. The higher the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and strengthen into solid deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>

<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services New Milford NJ</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
