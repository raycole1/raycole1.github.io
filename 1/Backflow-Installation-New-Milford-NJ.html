<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most widespread and destructive water problems: hard water.  Hard water ruined the modern-day house. Scale builds up in your pipes, clogging them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale significantly reduces the life-span of home appliances like dishwashers, coffee machine and ice devices.

<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services New Milford NJ</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
