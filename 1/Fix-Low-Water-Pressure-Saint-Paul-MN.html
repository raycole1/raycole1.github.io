<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. An action team is available for preliminary examination of sewer emergencies every day of the year. If sewage from the City-maintained part of the sewer system supports through toilets or sinks, call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance staff at (503) 823-1700. City employees will examine and eliminate obstructions in the mainline sewer and the part of the service line that the City is responsible for. You may have to wait until the storm has diminished to have the backup dealt with if the problem is the result of too much storm water in the system.</p>
<p>2 styles of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks. A PVB may be utilized to separate health or non-health hazards but works versus back-siphonage only.</p>
