<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to avoid backflow. The basic means of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>Your disposer may feature a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, rather of the standard plumber's putty as outlined listed below. Both will produce a good seal (though the gasket might result in small amounts of water collecting around the flange), and what's used is mainly a matter of choice. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
