<h3>When To Call A Plumber Garrett IN</h3>
<p>We truly care about our clients and the services that we provide. As tough water travels through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with salt ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are replaced quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, totally free" sodium ions are launched into the water.
