<h3>Useful Tips for Water Heater Repair at Acton CA</h3>
<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are lots of aspects that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that accelerate deterioration Likewise, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of corrosion control. Thus, thinking about all these factors, in addition to arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
