<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Plymouth Meeting PA?</h3>

For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that speed up deterioration Likewise, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of rust control. Therefore, thinking about all these elements, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
