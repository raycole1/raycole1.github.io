<p>To minimize the need of gas line repair, it is essential to understand the common reasons for gas leakages. Indoor gas leakages from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning devices occur most frequently in the winter. This is due to the fact that houses are not sufficiently aerated during the cooler months to prevent heat loss. If you have not done so already, we advise installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to alert you of any potential gas leaks.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure.
