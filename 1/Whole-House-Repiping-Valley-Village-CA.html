<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Valley Village CA</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to resolve tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
