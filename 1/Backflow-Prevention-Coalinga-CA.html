<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least three attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his knowledge and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the particles went down the recently cleaned main drain. By adding perseverence and persistence the task was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>
