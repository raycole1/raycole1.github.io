<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets need to absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet should be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural stability of the home.</p>

This distinction in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water streams in the regular direction.</p>
