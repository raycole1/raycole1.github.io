<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and elsewhere throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly used in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and avenues, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>At the top of the old disposer, put the wrenchette or a screwdriver" into the right side of one of the lugs in the mounting ring. While holding the bottom of the disposal with the other hand, turn the mounting ring counterclockwise to release the disposal. Know that the disposal may contain water and food waste, so bring it outside right-side up.</p>
<p>To remove the cord from the old disposer, use a screwdriver to get rid of the plate covering the electrical connections at the bottom of the unit. Detach the wire nuts and pull the cable through the cover plate hole. For preventive maintenance, Larry & Sons uses annual checkups on your sewer and septic tanks. Our service technicians thoroughly check your entire drainage system with video camera pipe inspection to prevent future problems before they occur. Our annual maintenance services likewise consist of detailed drain cleaning to keep your pipes clear.</p>
