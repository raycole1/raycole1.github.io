<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
