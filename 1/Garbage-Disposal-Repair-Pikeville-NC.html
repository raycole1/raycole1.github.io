<p>Most houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the outer covering of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>After inspection, the work or a portion thereof shall be noted as satisfying as finished, or the license holder will be notified regarding where the work stops working to comply with the Uniform Code. Building work not in compliance with code provisions shall be needed to stay exposed up until it has been brought into compliance with the code, been re inspected, and been found satisfactory as completed.</p>
