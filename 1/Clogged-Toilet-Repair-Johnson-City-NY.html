<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that controls water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't set up appropriately, you may experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in lost water.</p>

<h3>Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Plumbers Johnson City NY</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
