<p>Inside the home, inspect the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for drips or leaks. Examine beneath sinks to check for leaking pipes. Local plumber estimated cost of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ delighted I inspected around.
