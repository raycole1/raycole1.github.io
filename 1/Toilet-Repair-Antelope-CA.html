Your kitchen may become clogged by food or grease, while in the bathroom it might be hair or pieces of soap that cause the clog. Your toilet may end up being stopped due to excess paper being flushed, or you could have a house-wide backup triggered by sewage coming back up through the pipes.</p>
<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

<p>If you 'd like to remove the salt, just fill the brine tank with potassium chloride pellets, not salt pellets. The only issue is that potassium chloride is costly: $25 to $30 per 50-pound bag. Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag. A hydro jetter is a pump-and-hose system that uses high-powered water jets to clear residential and commercial drain pipes.
