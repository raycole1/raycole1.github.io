<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Choctaw OK</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
