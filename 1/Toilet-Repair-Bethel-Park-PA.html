<p>Set out the brand-new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I have actually been to lots of carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener.

<p>New houses developed with copper pipes are specifically prone to corrosive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to become covered within. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a period of 3 to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Many new houses are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
