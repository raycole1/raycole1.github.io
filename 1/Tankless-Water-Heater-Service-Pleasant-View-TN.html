Over time sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper performance, and draining a gallon or two helps remove the sediment. If you find a leak and opt for a patching job instead of a repiping task, just bear in mind that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the same material and they may be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to consider repiping your entire house when you identify a leak.</p>
