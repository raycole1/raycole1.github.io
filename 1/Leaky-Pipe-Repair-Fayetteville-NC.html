<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Fayetteville NC</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger thousands of dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule. So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers manage all types of work.

<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as tough water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
