<p>Waste disposal unit clogged or broken? Whether you need repairs or replacement, we've got you covered in the Cincinnati area. Garbage disposals are designed to operate in one of two methods. Either through what's called a batch feed, where the system is filled, then covered before it is switched on, or through a constant feed, where the system can be filled while it is running.</p>
<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that manages water circulation in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't set up correctly, you may experience a frequently or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
