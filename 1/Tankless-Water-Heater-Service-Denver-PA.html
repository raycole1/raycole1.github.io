<p>Making use of backflow preventers is connected to the water's usage. Backflow preventers are used to make sure the security and pureness of the dispersed water. Industrial supply of water normally has a minimum requirement of quality, depending on the industrial process in question. Agriculture on the other hand has less stringent water quality requirements.

<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General. Within the structure envelope consisting of listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a component, sub-system, or system group is replaced, an authorization and inspection shall not be required.
