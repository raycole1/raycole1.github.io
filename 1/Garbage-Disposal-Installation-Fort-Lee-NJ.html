When your water lines are repiped, it just suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have actually never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing regular and major leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can in fact be the less expensive and better long-lasting option if you do have regular leakages.</p>

Simply sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can resolve the problem. The specialists and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you always have a copy for your insurance city, real estate agent or company inspector.</p>
