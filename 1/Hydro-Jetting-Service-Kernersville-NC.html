<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can buy models with special features that do everything however include the salt, you will spend for each additional function. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm warranty that the special feature will not stop working. Depending upon the water source, you might have to filter turbid water or decontaminate bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening system. Lastly, if you own a septic tank, you ought to think about the extra load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates suggest that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regrowth cycle. This might or may not cause hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
<p>A minimum of as soon as every 3 months, drain water from the tank. Gradually sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct efficiency, and draining a gallon or two helps eliminate the sediment. If you find a leak and opt for a patching task rather of a repiping job, just keep in mind that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the very same material and they may be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your whole home when you spot a leak.</p>
