<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>

When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
