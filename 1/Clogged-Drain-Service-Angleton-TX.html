<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which styles are best for certain applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are defined by ecological regulations and local statutes. Local building codes for instance will require a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air space between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon before it can happen, avoiding contaminating water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more sophisticated and complicated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices installed to avoid backflow variety from the fairly easy to the extremely sophisticated and complicated.</p>

<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
