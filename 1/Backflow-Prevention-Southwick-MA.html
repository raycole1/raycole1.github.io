For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that speed up deterioration Likewise, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of rust control. Thus, thinking about all these factors, as well as arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
