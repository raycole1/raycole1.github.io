<h3>Kitchen Sink Leaking in Clinton New York</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink.

Using his understanding and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink.

<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Clinton NY</h3>
<p>The EcoWater Compact Series Water Softening System is a compact single tank cabinet" design softener, making it a reliable and practical  system for your house. Friendly, knowledgeable technician. He got our drain cleared out in a really efficient and professional  manner. I would not be reluctant to call Roto-Rooter for any future needs. Toilet Runs Intermittently - Don't you dislike it when the toilet runs 5 minutes after you flushed? It generally suggests there is an issue with the flapper, or the toilet is leaking water someplace.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
