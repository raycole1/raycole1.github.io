<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain appropriately or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help.

In many cases, a handyman might figure out that a replacement part is essential (like a tailpiece, pvc, or reducer  trap) to ensure normal operation for your drain.
