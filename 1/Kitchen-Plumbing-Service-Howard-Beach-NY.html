<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Howard Beach NY</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally preserved at a substantial pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may be or fail lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
