I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
