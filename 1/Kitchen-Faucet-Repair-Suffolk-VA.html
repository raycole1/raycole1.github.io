<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc designed and built a smaller design that ran on the exact same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also constructed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and community sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
