Just after responding to the following questions need to you address repair or replace. Do you understand how many years old your hot water heater is? Do you know the number of years it's rated for? Think about replacement instead of repair if it is close to the number of years the water heater was rated for.</p>

<p>The Final Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that manages water circulation in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't installed appropriately, you might experience a frequently or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in squandered water.</p>
