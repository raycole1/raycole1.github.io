<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
