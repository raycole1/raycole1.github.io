<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Berlin CT</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these concerns.</p>
