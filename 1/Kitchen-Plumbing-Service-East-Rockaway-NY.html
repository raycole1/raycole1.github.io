<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies East Rockaway NY</h3>
<p>The most efficient method to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>

It is necessary to go out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you react to an issue, the better chance you'll need to conserve time and money on hot water heater services.</p>
