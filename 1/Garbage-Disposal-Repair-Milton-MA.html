<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. If permitted to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the contaminated water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, in addition to checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
