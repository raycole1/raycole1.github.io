<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Powhatan VA</h3>
<p>Rust is a complex phenomenon and there are numerous aspects that accelerate rust in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate deterioration Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of rust control. Therefore, considering all these factors, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>

Your local Culligan Male will review the solidity of your water, the size of your household and even your house's plumbing before advising the ideal water softening service for you and your spending plan.
