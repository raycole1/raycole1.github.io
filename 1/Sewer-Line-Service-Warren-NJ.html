<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Warren NJ</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were really responsive and timely to send me a bid which was very competitive. They were extremely professional and did a remarkable job. I would definitely call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this staining just appears when hot water is being used, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still an issue that needs to be dealt with immediately (you'll likely need a new water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
