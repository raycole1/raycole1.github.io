<h3>Heating, Cooling, Electrical And Plumbing Services Warwick RI</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
