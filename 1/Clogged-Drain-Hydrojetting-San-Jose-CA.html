<p>Our Water Softeners Are Brilliantly Created To Work. 2 fantastic benefits of having a disposal unit set up are: 1) that it makes clean up around the kitchen easier, and 2) it significantly minimizes the amount of organic waste that you have to deal with. Both deserve considering for your kitchen, but those advantages are just offered to those who purchase quality units that are also installed by a professional plumber. Too often we see disposal systems ruined by inappropriate installation. Taking a faster way by installing it yourself can often cause a lack of efficiency and regular repairs down the line.</p>

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
