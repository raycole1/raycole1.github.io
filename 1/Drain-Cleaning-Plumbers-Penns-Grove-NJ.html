<p>Hidden water leakages are frequently difficult and have Potentially Major Consequences. Replacing your flapper might require slightly various actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before eliminating the flapper.)

If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
