<p>If you have sensitive skin, eczema, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis or dry winter itch it's a very good idea to change a precipitating water softener for a non-precipitating water softener. Non-precipitating water softeners do not increase the alkalinity of water and do not leave behind a scum which might collect within your energies. Is your old water heater breaking down?
