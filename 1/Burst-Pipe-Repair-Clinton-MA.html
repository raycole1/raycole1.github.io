<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is common in our industry and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately interacting that you can attain this.</p>
