<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being damaged or clogged, it could wreak unwanted problems on your home.

For example, if your kitchen sink is supported due to the fact that you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a fast drain snaking can separate the obstruction and send it down the pipes.

This is an excellent indicator that your pipes may be rusting from the within and therefore, need to be changed.
