<p>New England Pipe Restoration is the premier sewer repair provider in the Northeast. While this might appear like a problem with your faucet, it's normally caused by something else - like a plumbing problem or problem with your water heater. More and more people are selling their old water heaters for new, tankless variations. Whether you're wanting to increase your home's eco-friendliness or simply plain tired of lacking warm water, a tankless hot water heater might be the best solution for you.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as displayed in Picture 1. Water is most likely escaping through a cracked or worn away overflow tube if extra pressure on the flapper does not stop the running sound. In that case, you have to separate the tank from the bowl and replace the whole flush valve. Since the overflow tube is rarely the cause of a running toilet, we won't cover that repair here.</p>

Unlike residential swimming pools, public or community swimming pools need to use only RP devices or Air Gaps on their refill lines. An RP on a public or community pool need to be evaluated upon installation and then annually.</p>
