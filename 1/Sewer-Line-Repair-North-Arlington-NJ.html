<p>Hidden water leakages are frequently stressful and have Potentially Severe Repercussions. Changing your flapper might require somewhat various steps than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve.

If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
