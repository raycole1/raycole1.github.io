When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Current guidelines restrict the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines.

<p>The next step we must carry out in the repair process, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have actually cleaned the body, and the fixed elements are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or particles. This can be tricky, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be used to assure the line is properly flushed.</p>
<p>The most convenient way to keep you and your family safe from the prospective threats of backflow through cross connections is to not develop cross connections in the very first place. However, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, pool, water function or other kind of cross connection, have actually an approved backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
