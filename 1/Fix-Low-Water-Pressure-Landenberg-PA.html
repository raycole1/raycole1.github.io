<p>Backflow preventers need to just be fixed when the data gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has actually deteriorated in its efficiency listed below the established minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if required, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This indicates the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
