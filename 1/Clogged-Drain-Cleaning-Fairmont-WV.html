<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Fairmont WV</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Regrettably, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leakages happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
