<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can purchase designs with unique functions that do whatever however include the salt, you will spend for each additional function. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm guarantee that the unique function will not stop working.
