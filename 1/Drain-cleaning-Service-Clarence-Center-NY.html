<p>Woodbury, in addition to lots of other communities and organizations, has found the best way to prevent these stains from happening is by minimizing the variety of times your water softener regrows. "Regenerating" refers to the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it becomes "exhausted" or complete.
