<p>Electric hot water heater do have a few drawbacks however that deserve explaining. Firstly, electrical power is not as inexpensive as gas. Some utility companies charge greater rates for electrical energy during peak periods such as extremely early in the morning and in the evening.

At the least, it would have been an extremely costly alternative.</p>
