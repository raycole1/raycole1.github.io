<p>Waste disposal unit service warranties last an average of 5 years, but they can vary between 2 and ten years. Given that the typical life expectancy of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you might wish to buy a prolonged service warranty. Most guarantees cover the cost to repair and replace regular wear and tear failures. To prevent more breakdowns, property owners must stay up to date with routine maintenance of their waste disposal unit.</p>
<p>In addition to the garbage disposal system, there are a number of upgrades and parts that you might need to consider when weighing the waste disposal unit installation cost. For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or lower pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
