Water will leak into the cabinet beneath if the leak is far enough down the water line.

As structure types and contents of these buildings can be very different, we need to comprehend that the fire defense system for any installation needs to be created and installed to fulfill that particular risk or need. An aircraft hangar will need an extremely various fire defense system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these 2 examples would also differ significantly.</p>
