This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
