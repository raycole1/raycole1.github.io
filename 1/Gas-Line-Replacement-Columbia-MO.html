For obstructions that occur even more down the pipe, use a cable auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made of long, versatile steel cable wound around a spool with a hand crank. To use a cable auger, get rid of the horizontal P-trap below the sink, making certain it is not clogged prior to proceeding. Pull out 18 inches of cable at a time, crank the deal with in a clockwise direction and push the auger forward at the same time.

<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler typically are installed in areas where water might trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
