<p>When the end user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the regular direction from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water presses the spring-loaded check valves open. The tension of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure difference in the Zone of Minimized Pressure. This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water flows in the regular direction.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to avoid backflow. The fundamental means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
