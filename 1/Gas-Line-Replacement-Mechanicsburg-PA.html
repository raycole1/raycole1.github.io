A waste disposal unit usually plugs into a 120-volt GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruptor) outlet under the sink.

<p>The client has 1 month to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notice of Requirements form).

<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to prevent backflow. The basic means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the culprit. But not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
