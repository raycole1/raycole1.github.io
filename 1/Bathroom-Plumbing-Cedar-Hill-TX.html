<p>Hidden water leakages are typically demanding and have Possibly Serious Effects. Changing your flapper may require slightly different actions than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To discover an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, however chances are you'll find among the exact same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
<p>When the only answer to your water heater troubles is to replace the entire system, the very best option is to upgrade to something that is energy efficient.

A number of them use foam insulation rather than the conventional fiberglass.</p>
