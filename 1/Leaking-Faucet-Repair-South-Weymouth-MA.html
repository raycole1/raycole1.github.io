<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is typical in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can attain this.</p>
