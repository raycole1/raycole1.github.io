<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
