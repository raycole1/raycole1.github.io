<p>When choosing the correct system protection there are several considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation ought to be taken a look at on a specific basis as a distinct stand-alone system.

The backflow protection requirements for these 2 examples would also vary significantly.</p>

After they gave me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, because I never want to see this company once again.</p>
