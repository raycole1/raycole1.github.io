<p>Backflow is dangerous since it can pollute the general public drinking supply with pollutants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and hazardous chemicals. In 2010, for instance, students at a Bowling Green, Kentucky primary school suffered queasiness and other signs after a contractor working on the HVAC system caused the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>The simplest way to keep you and your family safe from the potential dangers of backflow through cross connections is to not create cross connections in the first place. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, swimming pool, water feature or other type of cross connection, have an approved backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>

<p>Just how much is a sewer line inspection? These specialized evaluations consist of specialized camera equipment that runs into your sewer line.
