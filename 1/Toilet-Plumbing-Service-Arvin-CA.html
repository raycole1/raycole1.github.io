<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is common in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace.
