The fundamental ways of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the offender. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.
