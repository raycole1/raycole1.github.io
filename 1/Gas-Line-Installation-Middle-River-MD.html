<p>Backflow preventers are important for producing a safe supply of water system. No matter which design you pick, all water softeners need to be appropriately kept. The brine solution should be combined and saved in the salt water tank. Periodic obstructing of the resin also requires unique attention. For example, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Often, normal backwashing with water will fix this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help separate the product. Likewise, bacteria and fungis also form mats in the resin that minimize its effectiveness. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these nuisances. However, check out the manufacturer's guidelines prior to adding any chemicals to the system.</p>

If you have two meters, drinkable and watering, you are likewise needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
