<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has space to hang on to favorable ions. The fresh media starts by holding on to the weaker charged sodium ions. As hard water travels through your water softener tank, the more powerful charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet.

<p>In municipal supply of water systems, water is generally preserved at a substantial pressure to enable water to flow to and out of the plumbing components in your home or business. When the pressure drops for some reason such as might take place when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to combat a fire or a water main breaks or some other situation takes place, contaminated water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an event, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention technique utilized. The very best and best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the component).
