<p>Some plumbers charge more for their services than others, but that's typically an indicator of their quality. Normally speaking, more knowledgeable plumbers will charge more for their services. Tankless water heaters get rid of the long haul for heat of the traditional warm water tank. Plumbing pipes, like everything else, wear gradually.
