<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent.

This activates the disc to open, allowing air to go into the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
