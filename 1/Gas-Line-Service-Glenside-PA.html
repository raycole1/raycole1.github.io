<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we suggest you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner.

When this occurs, it may be time to contact a professional from Atlas Plumbing to investigate.</p>
<p>It might be time to get it changed if your water heater has actually needed multiple repairs over the last few years.

If the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more monetary sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
