<p>As described earlier in the post, carbon monoxide is entirely odorless and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every home should have carbon monoxide detectors installed at the correct locations. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single homes to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are typically offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new installations must have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>

Lime softening increases the pH of the water, which develops an inhospitable environment for disease-causing bacteria. This is the first barrier in the Cedar Rapids Water Division's multi-barrier disinfection procedure.</p>
