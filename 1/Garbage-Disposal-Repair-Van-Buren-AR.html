<h3>Need An Emergency Plumber Van Buren AR</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

If your pipes are gurgling or producing nasty odors, you'll know this.</p>
