When an ion exchanger is gotten water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as sodium or potassium.</p>
<p>If your polybutylene pipes have failed, read your insurance plan thoroughly. Make certain you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurer will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims might be denied since the basic HO-3 house owners' policy particularly omits "a loss as the result of a water leak over a prolonged time period."
