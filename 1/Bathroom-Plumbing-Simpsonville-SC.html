When an ion exchanger is gotten water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as sodium or potassium.</p>
<p>If your polybutylene pipes have failed, read your insurance plan thoroughly. Make certain you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurer will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims might be denied since the basic HO-3 house owners' policy particularly omits "a loss as the result of a water leak over a prolonged time period." Call your insurance coverage representative and verify your protection. Double check with your agent to confirm that your understanding is right once you have read through your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered.</p>
