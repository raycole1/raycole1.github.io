<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.

That is not the case with the FutureSoft system.

The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
