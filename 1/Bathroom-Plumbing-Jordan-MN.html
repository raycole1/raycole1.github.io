<p>Climatic vacuum breakers (AVB) are the simplest design of backflow preventer. If you have less than six control valves, they are the least expensive, but also the least reliable choice. These devices are not created as a whole-system backflow prevention valve; one must be set up at every control valve.

<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>For RPZ devices, drainage capacity will be sized to accommodate both periodic discharges and a devastating failure of the relief valve. Describe makers flow curves to identify maximum discharge rate based on supply pressure or on-site pressure; whichever is higher.
