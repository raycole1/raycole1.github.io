If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
