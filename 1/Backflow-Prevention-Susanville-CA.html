<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Susanville CA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
