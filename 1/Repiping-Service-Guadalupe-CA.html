<p>You live in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever replaced its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to wear away and burst when they get old. You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
