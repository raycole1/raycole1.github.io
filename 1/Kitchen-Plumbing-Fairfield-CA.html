<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. If enabled to return to the supply of water, there is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, as well as checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
