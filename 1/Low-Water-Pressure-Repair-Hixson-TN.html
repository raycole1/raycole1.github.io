<p>The toilet takes a truly long period of time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout typical operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves-- referred to as the zone of minimized pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is designed to open and discharge water to the outdoors, ensuring backflow never ever happens.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might have to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug kit that I purchased independently from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>In most cases, a lack of hot water is triggered by a malfunctioning breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. If the water is lukewarm, the dip tube inside the tank may be broken. Scalding water is usually the result of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water threatens and need to be immediately addressed by a skilled plumbing professional.</p>
