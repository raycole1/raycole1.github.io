<p>Due to the fact that of a concern at the point of installation or because of maintenance, water softeners leaks are primarily caused. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated correctly. It can also trigger the system to leak if the bypass valve is cracked. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed over time. A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration processes. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. It is likely broken and merely needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
