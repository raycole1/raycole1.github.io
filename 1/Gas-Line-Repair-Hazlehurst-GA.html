<p>Tru-Soft Â® Solar Brine Blocks are produced for the requirements of many water softener units. Current Evaluation: Howard, the Project Manager, has always been informative and helpful relating to all our concerns. He did the proposition and arranged the work for the clean out and partial sewer line repair without delay. It is always an enjoyment to work with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outdoors kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He was able to get a snake around the "Y", which many plumbers say they can't do, and clear the line. He is always pleasant, professional and goes the extra mile.</p>
<p>You wish to save water. Older toilets use up to 7 gallons of water per flush and are much less water-efficient than newer designs. U.S. Epa's WaterSense toilets utilize less than 1.6 gallons per flush. Changing your toilet with a new design can conserve thousands of gallons of water - lowering your utility bills and assisting the environment.</p>

<p>If your polybutylene pipes have stopped working, read your insurance plan completely. Make sure you know what is covered and what is not covered. Lots of insurance provider will not cover a slow leak. Claims might be rejected because the standard HO-3 house owners' policy particularly omits "a loss as the result of a water leak over an extended amount of time." Call your insurance agent and verify your protection. Once you have actually gone through your policy and verified what is covered and what is not covered, double check with your representative to confirm that your understanding is appropriate.</p>
