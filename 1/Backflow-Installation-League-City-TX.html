<p>As an IMPORTANT SERVICES BUSINESS, we remain Readily available and open to assist with any of your plumbing, drain, heating, cooling or electrical needs. The waste disposal unit is one of the most misused devices in the whole home. Couple of homeowners understand that a disposal is created particularly to manage food residue rinsed from a plate-- not whole pieces of leftovers! Large quantities of food can rapidly overwhelm the system and trigger a comprehensive clog. That's why Pratt Plumbing receives so many telephone call asking for waste disposal unit repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as displayed in Image 1. Water is likely leaving through a cracked or corroded overflow tube if extra pressure on the flapper does not stop the running noise. In that case, you have to remove the tank from the bowl and replace the entire flush valve. Because the overflow tube is rarely the cause of a running toilet, we will not cover that repair here.</p>
