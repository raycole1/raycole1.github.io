<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system must be continually monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
