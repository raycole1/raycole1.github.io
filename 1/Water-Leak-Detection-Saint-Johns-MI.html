<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
