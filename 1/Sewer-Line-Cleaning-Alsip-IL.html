<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of three attempts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl.

With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the freshly cleaned main drain.

It is recommended that you enable your unit to go empty of one type of salt before adding another to prevent the incident of any problems.
