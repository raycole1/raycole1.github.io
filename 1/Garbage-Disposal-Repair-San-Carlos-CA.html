<p>The Battelle Research study also discovered difficult water to rapidly cause clogged shower heads, in many cases after as little as a year and a half of regular use. After just one week of constant testing with hard water, more than three-fourths of shower head nozzles ended up being clogged, according to lab outcomes. Shower heads using water treated by a water softening system, meanwhile, carried out almost in addition to on the day they were set up.</p>
<p>After arriving after their window, they started to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen tossed up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take obligation if it leaked now since of some undefined curiosity in how my sink was put together. After they provided me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, considering that I never wish to see this company again.</p>
<p>Your company has actually been really helpful to me for a long time. The young man who came a couple of days earlier was so honest with me.
