<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. A permit is not required for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided changes are not made in the existing piping or components. A typical water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>
<p>Homeowners typically forego maintenance and care for their garbage disposal. When we require it, we simply anticipate this workhorse located under the sink to function as intended.
