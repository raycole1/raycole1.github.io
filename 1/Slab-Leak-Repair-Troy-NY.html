When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is essential that only initial factory repair parts are utilized.

<p>Mixing vaporized salt with rock salt is not advised, as this could clog the softening tank. It is advised that you allow your system to go empty of one type of salt prior to adding another to avoid the occurrence of any problems.
