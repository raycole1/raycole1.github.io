<p>During typical operation, the pressure between the two check valves, described as the zone of reduced pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is developed to open and release water to the outside.

For this reason, the RPZ should be installed in locations that are not subject to water damage and allow adequate drainage.</p>
