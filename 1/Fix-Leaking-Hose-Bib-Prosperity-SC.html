<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
