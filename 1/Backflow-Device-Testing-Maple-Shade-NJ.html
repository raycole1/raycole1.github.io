<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
