For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, reduced or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>

Cleaners need to be used according to producer instructions to avoid contamination.</p>
