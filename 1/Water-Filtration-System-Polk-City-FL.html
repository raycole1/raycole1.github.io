The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems contains the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire defense system are designed to match the hazard that exists in the places they are set up in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be very different, we need to comprehend that the fire security system for any installation requires to be designed and set up to fulfill that particular danger or need. An aircraft hangar will need a very different fire defense system than the system required in an apartment building.
