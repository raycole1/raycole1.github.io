<p>It can be a dangerous task when it comes to gas line installation and repair. Trying to install a gas line on your own can cause electrocution, fire, or electrical wiring concerns.

No, but you might have to collaborate with a Vectren representative to access to your home to carry out service work, consisting of relighting your gas appliances.</p>
<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are primarily time related.

Many plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
