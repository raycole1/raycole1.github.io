<p>Most houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition defense.
