<p>Poorly set up gas lines cause gas leakages. Gas leaks are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself project. The gas lines have to be calibrated to the right levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy states that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the second greatest energy consuming area of a house, next to cooling and heating. The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>
