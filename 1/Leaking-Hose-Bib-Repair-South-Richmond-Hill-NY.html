<p>Backflow preventers are important for developing a safe water supply system. No matter which design you choose, all water softeners need to be properly preserved. The brine solution must be mixed and saved in the brine tank. Routine blocking of the resin also needs special attention. For example, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, regular backwashing with water will solve this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Likewise, germs and fungi also form mats in the resin that decrease its efficiency. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these nuisances. However, check out the manufacturer's directions before including any chemicals to the unit.</p>
