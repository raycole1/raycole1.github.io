If there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running beneath your house's foundation, the best you can wish for is to learn quickly.

<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is generally utilized in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
