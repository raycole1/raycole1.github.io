<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Mount Gilead OH</h3>
<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has area to hold on to positive ions. The fresh media starts by holding on to the weaker charged sodium ions. As hard water goes through your water softener tank, the more powerful charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Because the hardness minerals have a higher favorable charge than the sodium, they will knock the sodium ions off and take their location.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
