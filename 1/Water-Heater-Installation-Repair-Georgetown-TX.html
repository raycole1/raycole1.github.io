<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains significant amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its many intended usages around your house.</p>

This can happen in multiple places and any combination of drains. For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine.
