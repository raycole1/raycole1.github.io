<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. A permit is not needed for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or components. A typical water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a close-by drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>If you notice a smell or undesirable smell originating from your system, which is not uncommon, consider purchasing a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can escape.

To prevent leaks from springing during the installation procedure, turned off the water system to your home.
