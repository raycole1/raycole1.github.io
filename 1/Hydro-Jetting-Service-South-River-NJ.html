<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>For home purchasers, an entire home and sewer camera inspection is an excellent idea to make sure no potential problems are left uncovered. The drain is linked, and the disposal linked to its mount 1 The remainder of the plumbing is reconnected to the disposal and to the dishwasher.
