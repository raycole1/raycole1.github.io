<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to avoid backflow. The basic means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.

<p>So, if you want to stop needing to wiggle your toilet deal with every time you flush and are tired and sick of publishing courteous signs in your bathroom everytime you have people over, get a new journey lever that actually works for your toilet. While certain specialty flush valves or flappers may require a specific journey lever to work appropriately, the majority of toilets will work just great with a "will fit" lever - which is excellent news for people who can't discover their model number or who possibly have remodeled or upgraded their components and desire a different surface or design handle to match the rest of their bathroom décor.</p>
