This can cause low circulation issues or even stop a component from streaming completely.

<p>The Last Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that controls water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed properly, you might experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in squandered water.</p>

Every house must have carbon monoxide detectors installed at the appropriate places.

They are usually offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all new installations should have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
