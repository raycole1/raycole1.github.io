After we have cleaned up the body, and the fixed elements are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles.

However, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, swimming pool, water function or other kind of cross connection, have actually an authorized backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
