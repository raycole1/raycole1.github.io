<p>Reach for a common household plunger if these combinations aren't effective in unclogging your sink. First seal off the 2nd side with a damp fabric or a stopper if you have a double sink. You'll need to create a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you mean to plunge with sufficient water to cover the bell of the plunger. Place the plunger firmly over the drain and plunge vigorously several times. When you hear the suction clear the clog, get rid of the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water.</p>
<p>It's constantly essential to work with a credible company like Daniels Plumbing, Heating and A/c, LLC to determine the most economical solution.
