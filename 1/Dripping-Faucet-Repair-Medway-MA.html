<p>Do you notice that you have dry or flaky skin, or does your water have a chemical or rotten egg odor? Sewer line repair is suggested when there are fractures or holes in your sewer line.

<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to eliminate the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals bring favorable charges, so water softeners use salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you water with safe and clean water, you are needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, safe and clean and irrigation, you are also required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
