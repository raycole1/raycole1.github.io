<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. A permit is not needed for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages offered modifications are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A normal water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a neighboring drain or drywell.</p>

That being said, the expected life expectancy of a tankless hot water heater is in between 15-20 years, which is nearly double that of a tank-style. The maker warranty is typically about two times that of a tank-style also. There are many situations where a tankless hot water heater would be of fantastic advantage for a busy household.</p>

Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
