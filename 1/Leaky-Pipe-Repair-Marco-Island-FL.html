<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to get rid of the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals carry favorable charges, so water softeners use salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you water with safe and clean water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, potable and irrigation, you are likewise required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
