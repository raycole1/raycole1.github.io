<p>Roots of trees can grow into sewer lines, even through really little openings. Call Stutzman Services if you suspect root development has actually caused a clog or damage to your sewer line.

<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer system determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth automatically begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regeneration generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
