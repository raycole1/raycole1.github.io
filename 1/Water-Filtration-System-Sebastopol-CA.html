<p>The most convenient method to keep you and your family safe from the possible risks of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the very first place. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, swimming pool, water feature or other kind of cross connection, have actually an approved backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>
<p>Softeners generally remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are typically referred to as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they need to be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a huge red flag that something more severe is wrong with them.</p>
<p>We highly recommend New Circulation Plumbing. There was a leak in our kitchen that was ruining our laminate floor. New Flow came out and fixed the leak on the day we called. They were on time and extremely professional. They also addressed their phones and returned phone calls in a prompt way. Our team will suggest the best toilet fit for your space and budget to ensure the installation is done properly. Whether you're changing old toilets for a more environmentally friendly lifestyle or a broken toilet has led you to the replacement, call us for our toilet installation services.</p>
