Private service pipelines are typically made from lead, plastic or type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be important.</p>

<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Brewster MA</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does happen regularly than you believe! Frequently it takes place during the night when you don't see the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and avenues, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
