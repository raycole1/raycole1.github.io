<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet at Vienna VA</h3>
<p>IRWD is devoted to providing safe, high quality water to consumers. Our substantial water quality program runs 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water provided to our customers is kept free from harmful contaminants. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices consisting of a nonpotable substance, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination might occur when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating and cooling system, into the safe and clean water supply. This can take place through a procedure known as backflow.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health threat if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of sickness or illness.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the reason for the issue. The line was plainly weakening; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
