<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually kept at a substantial pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might be or fail lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>You have probably seen drain cleaner items on the shelves at your local home improvement store, so when your drain gets clogged or isn't draining pipes water like it should, you may be lured to head down there and select some as much as fix it by yourself.
