When the pressure drops for some factor such as might happen when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to eliminate a fire or a water main breaks or some other situation takes place, contaminated water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an event, there requires to be some kind of backflow prevention method made use of. The very best and best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the component). The proper backflow prevention device is required if an air space is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is managed by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water provider.</p>
