We need our faucets and sinks to be working properly in order to maintain hygienic and safe living conditions as well.</p>
<p>The simplest way to keep you and your family safe from the possible risks of backflow through cross connections is to not create cross connections in the very first place. However, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, swimming pool, water feature or other type of cross connection, have an authorized backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>

A great general rule for hot water heater is this: since the life-span of the average hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
