<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant.

It is essential to get out in front of any problems as quick as possible. The quicker you respond to a concern, the much better chance you'll have to conserve time and money on water heater services.</p>
