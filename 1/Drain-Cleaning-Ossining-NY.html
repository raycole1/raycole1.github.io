<p>Water softeners come in all sizes and shapes and bigger absolutely does not imply better. WaterBoss ® utilizes fine mesh resin - smaller sized beads that actually provide more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to enable optimal capability in a minimum of area. Plus, our trademarked Directional Circulation Screen system helps ensure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also protect the resin bed, so we don't need to squander space on freeboard" which is the empty area in standard water softeners that allow a churning of resin throughout regrowth to release sediment, dirt and firmness.</p>
<p>At least once every 3 months, drain water from the tank. With time sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder performance, and draining a gallon or two assists remove the sediment. If you identify a leak and go with a patching job rather of a repiping task, just keep in mind that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the very same product and they may be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to think about repiping your whole house when you find a leak.</p>
