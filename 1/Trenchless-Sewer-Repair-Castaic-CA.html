<p>Many homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather protection. As the external covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Standard tank-type hot water heater include steel cylinders that are fed by a pipes that dips into a large tank. The water inside this tank is heated up and after that launched into the pipes of your home through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank.

You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control system outside for setting temperature levels and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
