For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, just one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>Examine the status of your water heater's anode rod if you see rust just in your hot water. You might need a professional to do this if you have actually never done this by yourself. The rust is most likely coming from the inside of your water heater if the anode rod is rusted out. If this is the case, replace your water heater as soon as possible. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you probably have worn away piping.</p>
