After we have actually cleaned the body, and the repaired parts are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be challenging, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be made use of to guarantee the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
