<p>So, how does a softener understand when to come down to service? The timing of regrowth depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, despite whether the water actually requires it. More recent systems use electronic sensors that monitor bead depletion and other key metrics based upon your water usage and therefore just regenerate when needed. These more recent systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect since they conserve energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
