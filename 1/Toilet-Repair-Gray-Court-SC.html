<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some disposer systems do not come with a power cable attached. Remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1) if this is the case. Be sure to buy a wiring kit with the proper power rating and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). Make sure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cable when you link the wiring harness to the disposer.</p>
<p>You also need to buy a backflow valve if you discover your water has an uncommon flow, taste, color or smell. A plumbing professional can determine whether the issue with your faucet is a quick fix or the outcome of other concerns in your house's plumbing system.
