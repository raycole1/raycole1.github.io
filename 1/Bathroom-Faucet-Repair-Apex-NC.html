<p>Won't drain - The unit may not be chopping food appropriately and waste may have clogged the drain pipe. Nevertheless, if there are a number of leaks within the system, or if there is evidence of corrosion in numerous locations, it is probably time to repipe. A water softener is packed with resin beads.
