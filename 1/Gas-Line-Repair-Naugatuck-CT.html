<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General. Within the structure envelope including below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a system, component, or sub-system  group is changed, an authorization and inspection will not be needed. If so desired, this shall not prevent the licensee from acquiring permits and inspections for such work.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another factor to consider. While you can acquire designs with special functions that do everything however add the salt, you will pay for each extra function. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm warranty that the unique feature will not stop working. Depending upon the water source, you might need to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening system. Finally, if you own a septic system, you should think about the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates indicate that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regrowth cycle. This may or may not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>

In either case, scalding water threatens and must be right away attended to by a trained plumbing professional.</p>
