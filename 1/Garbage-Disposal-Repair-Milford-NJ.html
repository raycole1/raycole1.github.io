<p>If your pipes are close to or past their useful life, it's time to think about replacing them completely. Pipe life-spans differ, however generally speaking, pipes 50 years or older need to be examined. Products typically utilized during the 1970s, such as galvanized steel, might have rusted by now. It's also essential to replace lead pipes as quickly as possible because of their unfavorable health effects in addition to polybutylene pipes, which tend to leak.</p>
