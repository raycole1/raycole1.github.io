<p>Do you see that you have dry or flaky skin, or does your water have a chemical or rotten egg smell? Sewer line repair is recommended when there are cracks or holes in your sewer line. Replacement of the line is recommended if damage is extreme. Bonney's expert plumbers can quickly retrofit your sink and install a brand-new immediate warm water heater together with a trendy immediate warm water faucet to match your kitchen design. 2 From below, position the gaskets and washers according to the maker's directions. Slip the installing ring onto the flange then slide on the snap ring till it snaps into place. Equally tighten up the three installing bolts, sealing the flange tightly against the sink.
