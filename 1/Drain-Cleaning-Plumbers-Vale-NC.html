<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material.

When you connect the circuitry harness to the disposer, ensure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cable.</p>
