<p>This veteran Oregon plumbing business takes care of both commercial and residential plumbing repairs. P-trap. If the P-trap under you sink is clogged, it can trigger water to develop all the way up your drains and develop a leak somewhere along the way. If you are annoyed by your 'constantly foggy' glassware; dull and dull laundry; rough hair and skin; and spotty tubs, sinks and toilets, call 2 Sons Plumbing today for setting up a water softener.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
