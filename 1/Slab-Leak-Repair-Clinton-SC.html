<p>Because the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to end up being covered inside, New houses developed with copper pipes are specifically vulnerable to destructive water conditions. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a period of three to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Many new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>

<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber Clinton SC</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>The sewer line in your house is a huge part of your house's plumbing. Your sewer line becomes part of your water supply that carries out all water and waste from your sinks, drains, and toilets. Keeping tabs on the status of your system is a vital part of being a homeowner. Left unattended, sewer line problems can cost countless dollars in repairs and damage to your house.</p>
