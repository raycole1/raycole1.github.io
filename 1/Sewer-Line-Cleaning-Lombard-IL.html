All leakages, worn fittings, and other plumbing problems will be solved.</p>

In one- and two-family houses, AWWA states that backflow preventers are not needed on lawn sprinkler built of authorized drinkable material and developed to flow water, so it doesn't stagnate. Instead, backflow requirements for domestic plumbing might use to those sprinkler systems.</p>
