When working with a double bowl kitchen sink, stuff the other opening with a rag, which assists use additional pressure to the clog. For obstructions that occur even more down the pipe, use a cable television auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made from long, flexible steel cable injury around a spindle with a hand crank. To utilize a cable television auger, get rid of the horizontal P-trap below the sink, making certain it is not clogged prior to continuing.
