<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct result on your security, convenience, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. This is exceptionally crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to press the waste out of your drain system. Existing guidelines restrict the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines.

<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and germs from ending up being a problem in your water system by sending out an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system. The signal triggers the minerals to join together, forming clusters that eventually form stable crystals. These crystals do not cling to surface areas like specific minerals would.</p>

<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were timely and very responsive to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were very professional and did an amazing task. I would certainly call them once again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this staining just appears when warm water is being used, then the rust most likely exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still an issue that requires to be dealt with right away (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) however not one that requires repiping.</p>
