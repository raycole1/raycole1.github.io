Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
