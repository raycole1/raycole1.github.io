<p>To figure out which toilet valve is triggering the problem, look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into the tube, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is listed below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, continuous outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water spots and rust.
