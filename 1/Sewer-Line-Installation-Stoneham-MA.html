<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is normal in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
