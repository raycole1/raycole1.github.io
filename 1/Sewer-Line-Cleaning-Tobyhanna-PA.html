<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which styles are best for certain applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are defined by ecological guidelines and local statutes. Local building codes for instance will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can take place, avoiding polluting water from being drawn back into the pipe system.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
