<p>The normal option is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.
