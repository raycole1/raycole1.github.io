<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
