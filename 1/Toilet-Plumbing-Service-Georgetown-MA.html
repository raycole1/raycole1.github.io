<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Georgetown MA?</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system should be constantly monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the structure envelope consisting of below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a component, sub-system, or system group is changed, a permit and inspection will not be needed. This will not preclude the licensee from obtaining authorizations and inspections for such work if so preferred.</p>
<p>In most cases, when you have a clogged drain or toilet, an auger is utilized to unclog the pipe and eliminate the particles. Depending upon the severity of the clog, or how far into your sewer pipe the clog is located, a high powered auger might be needed. Parker & Sons Plumbing values the security and security of all of our consumers, so our plumbers are all highly-trained and insured to guarantee you get safe and quality service.
