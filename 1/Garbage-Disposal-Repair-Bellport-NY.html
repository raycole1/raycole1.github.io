That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
