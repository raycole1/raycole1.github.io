<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
