<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
