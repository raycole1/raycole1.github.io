The intent of electrical inspection is to ensure compliance with the applicable electrical code in order to minimize personal, and structural electrical threats. First call your local energy company then call a plumber if you think a gas leak. Licensed professional plumbers will repair the gas and spot leak, provide licenses, and collaborate with the city for final inspections.
