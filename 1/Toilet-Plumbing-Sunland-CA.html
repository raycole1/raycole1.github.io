<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the best is normal in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
