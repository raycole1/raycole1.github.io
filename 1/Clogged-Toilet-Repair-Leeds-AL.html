<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the needed instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health threat if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, in addition to examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
