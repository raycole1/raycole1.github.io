<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Evergreen CO</h3>
<p>Deterioration is an intricate phenomenon and there are numerous elements that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate deterioration Likewise, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of rust control. Therefore, considering all these aspects, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
