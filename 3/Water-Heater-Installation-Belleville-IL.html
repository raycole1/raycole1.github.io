<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and somewhere else during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and avenues, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
