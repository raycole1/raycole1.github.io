One typical way for a house's supply of water to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines.

A backflow preventer not just safeguards drinking water in individual homes, it also avoids wastewater in personal homes from receding out and contaminating the general public supply of water.</p>
