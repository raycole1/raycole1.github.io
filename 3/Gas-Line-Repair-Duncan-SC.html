<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. Over time, like any other appliance in your house, your garbage disposal. may require repairs. A disposal system may begin or clog to leak through heavy, or inappropriate, usage. A leak somewhere in the system may show a worn seal.
