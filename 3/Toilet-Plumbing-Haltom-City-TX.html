When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated appropriately. It can also trigger the system to leak if the bypass valve is broken. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced over time.

A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. It is most likely broken and merely requires to be replaced if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>

In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, enabling air to enter the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
