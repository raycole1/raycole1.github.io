These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This means the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
