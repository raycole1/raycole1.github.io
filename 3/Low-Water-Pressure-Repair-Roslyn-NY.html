<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
