<p>The client has thirty days to complete installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notice of Requirements form). The majority of the time, a professional plumber can come out and discover the problem and make the repairs. In some circumstances, the toilet might be too old, and replacement parts are not readily available, so a replacement toilet is required.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to prevent backflow. The fundamental means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>A double check backflow preventer features 2 spring-loaded check assemblies to prevent back siphonage and back pressure on non-health risk (low danger) systems. Unscrew the coupling nut that connects the supply line. Hold its base with a locking pliers if the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank. Tip: Toss a towel on the floor underneath to catch water that will drain from the line.</p>
