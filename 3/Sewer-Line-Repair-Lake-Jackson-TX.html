<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly cause thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule. So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers deal with all types of work. Their duties break out into two classifications: Plumbers who deal with standard repairs (frequently in emergency circumstances), and plumbers who concentrate on renovating additions and jobs.</p>

This is so it is easily noticeable from underground water lines, and also due to the fact that the plastic finishing in fact secures the pipe much better than a galvanized covering would.</p>
