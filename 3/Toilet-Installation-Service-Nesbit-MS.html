<p>As described previously in the article, carbon monoxide is colorless and entirely odor-free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every home should have carbon monoxide gas detectors set up at the correct locations. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family homes to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are usually sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all new setups need to have a 10-year non-serviceable kind of detector.</p>
<p>Softeners generally remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently referred to as 'hardness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they ought to be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a huge warning that something more serious is wrong with them.</p>
