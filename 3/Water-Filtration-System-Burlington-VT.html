<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Burlington VT</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leaks occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these problems.</p>
