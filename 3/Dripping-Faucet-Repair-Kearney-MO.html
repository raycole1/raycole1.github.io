<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of little, maybe less vital things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>

Running toilets can be the result of a corroded overflow pipe, worn flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve.
