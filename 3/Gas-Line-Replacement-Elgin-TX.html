<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
