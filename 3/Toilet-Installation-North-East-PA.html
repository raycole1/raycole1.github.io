And who wants to do all that work???

<p>When you remove the cap to flush out the valve, examine the washer for wear or fractures. Changing a bad washer is inexpensive and simple. But discovering the best washer might not be. The most typical washers are frequently available at home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be hard to find.

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed appropriately, you might experience a frequently or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>
