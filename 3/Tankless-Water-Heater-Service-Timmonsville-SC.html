<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system should be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>Plumbing is the practice, fixtures and materials used in the installation, maintenance, extension, and alteration of all piping, fixtures, plumbing appliances, and plumbing appurtenances in connection with hygienic drainage or storm drainage facilities; venting systems and personal or public water system systems, within or surrounding to any structure or structure.</p>
