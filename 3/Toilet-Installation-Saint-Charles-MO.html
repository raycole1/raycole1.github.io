<p>After showing up after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the two gentlemen tossed up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but declared they would not take responsibility if it dripped now since of some undefined oddities in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing.
