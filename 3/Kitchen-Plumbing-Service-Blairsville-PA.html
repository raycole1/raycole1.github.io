<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 efforts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his knowledge and experience he determined that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink.
