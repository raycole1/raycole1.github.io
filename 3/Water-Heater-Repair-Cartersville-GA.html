Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
