<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water supply surpasses the pressure in the drinkable system offering the makeup water. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its instructions of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Possible pollutants can then get in the drinkable water supply. The best method to lower accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is specifically tough with high mineral content, you might need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>
