<p>To determine which toilet valve is causing the difficulty, look at the overflow tube. There's an issue with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, continuous outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water discolorations and deterioration. However don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
