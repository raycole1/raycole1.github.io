<p>Concealed water leaks are typically stressful and have Potentially Serious Consequences. Changing your flapper may need somewhat different actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, but chances are you'll locate one of the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
