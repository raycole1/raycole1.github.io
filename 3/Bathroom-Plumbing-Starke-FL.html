Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
