<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General. Within the structure envelope consisting of below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a sub-system, system, or component  group is changed, a license and inspection shall not be required. If so wanted, this shall not prevent the licensee from obtaining licenses and inspections for such work.</p>
<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll discover that water runs to fill up the bowl. However, in an effectively working toilet, the water should stop running when the bowl is filled to its proper capacity.

These leaks are very inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up taking a trip through the overflow.</p>
