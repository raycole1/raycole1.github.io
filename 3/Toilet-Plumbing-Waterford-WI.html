<h3>Professional Experience Is Essential For A Good Plumber Waterford WI</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leaks take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these issues.</p>
