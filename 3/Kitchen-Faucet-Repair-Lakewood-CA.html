<p>Obvious odor. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the yard, basement, or anywhere in your house or service area, offer us a call. That odor might be originating from your sewer system, which needs repair immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your home, releases sewer gas, and controls atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will often need to be replaced instead of repaired. You'll understand this if your pipes are gurgling or discharging nasty smells.</p>

A drain specialist like TLC will use a camera to check your drain system. Frequently, if you have several drain problems you may have a drain line break someplace in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can find and identify the issue so the drain can be repaired.</p>
