<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages Kennesaw GA</h3>

Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
