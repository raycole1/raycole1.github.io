<p>This is an entirely valid question that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, of course, as essential as your water heater, water line, or drains. However, it includes a reasonable quantity of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a relatively little cylindrical device set up under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal system pulls down wastewater and any material particles by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such particles. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily flow into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>To schedule garbage disposal repair in the Greater Salt Lake City area, call SameDay at (801) 726-3329 or contact us online now.
