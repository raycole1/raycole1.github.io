<h3>Water Softener Repair in Durham North Carolina</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Durham NC</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
