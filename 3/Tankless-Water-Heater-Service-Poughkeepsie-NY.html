Our extensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water provided to our clients is kept devoid of hazardous pollutants. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment containing a nonpotable substance, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination may occur when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating & cooling system, into the drinkable water system.
