<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in Spring Lake MI</h3>

If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past.

Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
