<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
