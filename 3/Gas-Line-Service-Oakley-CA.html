Customer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to try to get an estimate from personal plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of the businesses we called would give a price quote over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the scenario before committing to a rate, and all wanted to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks discovered only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
