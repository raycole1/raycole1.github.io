Some utility companies charge higher rates for electricity during peak durations such as extremely early in the morning and in the evening.

If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
