<p>Plumbing is the practice, materials and components used in the installation, maintenance, extension, and modification of all piping, fixtures, plumbing appliances, and plumbing appurtenances in connection with sanitary drainage or storm drainage centers; venting systems and public or personal water system systems, within or adjacent to any structure or structure.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug package that I bought separately from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>A cross connection is a connection between a drinkable drinking supply of water and a possible source of contamination or pollution. Under the arrangements of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1971, the Epa (EPA) recognized national standards for safe drinking water. Each state is required to implement the various regulations of the Safe Drinking Water Act and how it connects to its state laws.</p>
