For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate deterioration Likewise, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of rust control. Hence, considering all these elements, as well as arise from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
