<p>In municipal water supply systems, water is normally maintained at a significant pressure to allow water to flow to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your house or business. When the pressure drops for some factor such as may take place when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to eliminate a fire or a water main breaks or some other scenario occurs, contaminated water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an occurrence, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention approach used. The very best and safest kind of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). If an air space is not possible, then the correct backflow prevention device is required. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is regulated by the Ohio Epa and your water supplier.</p>
