<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Mentone CA</h3>

<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
