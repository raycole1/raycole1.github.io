<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the first most apparent indications of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a larger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your house. Even if the problem originates with the community system, it's still wise to generate the experts to limit the damage to your house.</p>
<p>If your water heater has actually needed several repairs over the last couple of years, it may be time to get it changed.

If the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more monetary sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
