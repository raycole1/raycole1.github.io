<p>To identify which toilet valve is triggering the difficulty, look at the overflow tube. If water is overflowing into television, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, continuous outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water spots and rust.
