<p>After showing up after their window, they started to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but claimed they would not take responsibility if it dripped now since of some undefined oddities in how my sink was put together. After they provided me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, since I never wish to see this company once again.</p>
