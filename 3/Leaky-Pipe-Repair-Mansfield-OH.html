<p>Check the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is easy and inexpensive. However finding the best washer may not be. The most common washers are often available at home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be difficult to discover. Eliminate it and take it to the store to find a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers normally replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are installed in locations where water could cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
