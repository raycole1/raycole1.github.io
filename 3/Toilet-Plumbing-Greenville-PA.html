<h3>Copper Pipe Repair in Greenville Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
