A used water valve can secure and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely split and just requires to be replaced.</p>
<p>To figure out which toilet valve is causing the difficulty, take a look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube.

That slow, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing totally. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water spots and rust.
