They need to be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local authorities, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only safeguard against back siphonage.</p>
