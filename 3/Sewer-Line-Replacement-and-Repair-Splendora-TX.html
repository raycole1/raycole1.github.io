<p>If a cable has actually not yet been gone to the junction box, you can make the connections within the brand-new disposer at any time beforehand, joining the cable television to the wires in package just before or simply after installing the disposer.

Items that would otherwise enter the garbage needs to not be put in your disposal. This includes glass, plastic, metals (yes, flatware), paper, anything combustible, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
