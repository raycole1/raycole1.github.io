<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
