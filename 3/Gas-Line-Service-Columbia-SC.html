<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; additional, more considerable expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for homeowners. If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist identify.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the perpetrator. But not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
