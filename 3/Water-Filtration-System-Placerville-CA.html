<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that controls water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't installed appropriately, you might experience a regularly or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in lost water.</p>
