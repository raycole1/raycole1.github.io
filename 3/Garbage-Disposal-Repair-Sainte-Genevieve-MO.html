If you decide to take on a bathroom remodel (for instance), you'll need to set up at least 2 assessments, including a rough-in inspection of the brand-new piping and a final checkup prior to connecting your home appliances.</p>
<p>If you decide to attempt this task yourself, be prepared to keep careful track of about a dozen small parts (put the stopper in the sink so none of them fall down the drain). There are various faucet designs, so you might not have the ability to tell what to replace up until you've done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or work with a plumber, this would be a great time to consider whether you wish to update the faucet with a new design.</p>
