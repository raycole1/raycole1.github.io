<p>The list of things a food disposer can take in is fairly short. Crisp or soft foods are great, however difficult or stringy foods can be trouble. Disposers can be stopped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, along with the usual kitchen flotsam, including pop-tabs, searching pads and twist-ties. While some older houses may not have backflow preventers, all newer residential or commercial properties are needed to have them. Doug's can help you locate and recognize them if you're not sure what kind of backflow preventers are utilized in your house or business. We can also perform your annual backflow inspections.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical compound that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces.
