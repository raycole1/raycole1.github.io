Funneling happens when the incoming difficult water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.

Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
