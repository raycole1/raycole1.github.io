<p>A waste disposal unit ought to not leak. It usually shows wear and tear which is a fair indication that its time is up when this happens. If you think about what you put down the disposal, leakages can be unhygienic and will also ultimately cause strain on other parts of your garbage disposal. The kitchen sink drain may need a simple tightening or a replacement. If the leak is in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the obvious spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you may have to fill the sink with water prior to analyzing the pipe below.</p>
