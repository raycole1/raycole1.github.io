<p>Every day you count on your hot water heater more than you might even realize.

<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and below the very first check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks. An RPBA is effective against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and might be used to isolate health or non-health hazards.</p>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in locations where water could cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
