<p>The majority of homes or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather protection. As the external coating of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
