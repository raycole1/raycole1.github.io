<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 South Bend IN</h3>

Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
