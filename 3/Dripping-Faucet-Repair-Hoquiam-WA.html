<p>Howard, the Project Supervisor, has always been helpful and handy regarding all our concerns. He did the proposal and set up the work for the clean out and partial sewer line repair promptly. It is always a pleasure to deal with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outdoors kitchen sink line which has a "Y".

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
