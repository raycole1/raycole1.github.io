<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that controls water circulation in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't installed effectively, you may experience a regularly or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in squandered water.</p>
