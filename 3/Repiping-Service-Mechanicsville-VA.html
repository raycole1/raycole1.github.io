<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains significant amounts of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many desired uses around your home.</p>
