<p>Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
