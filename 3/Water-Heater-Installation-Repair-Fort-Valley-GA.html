<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 efforts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his understanding and experience he determined that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the newly cleaned up main drain.

<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Fort Valley GA</h3>
<p>When a challenging clog is costing you your sanity, make it work with our Tewksbury drain cleaning professionals. Contact us or call us at (978) 355-1673 to get help today. Toilet continues to run - Either fill device has stopped working to shutoff or runs out modification sending out water into the bowl. Toilet flapper is broken and no longer sealing water from entering bowl.</p>
<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, you can try disposing a tray of ice down the drain, and then turn on the garbage disposal while running water. This will knock off any food particles stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it as well. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or worn out, worn sink? No problem is too great for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our knowledgeable plumbing group does the job rapidly and economically.</p>
<p>Softeners mainly get rid of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are often referred to as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they need to be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a huge red flag that something more severe is wrong with them.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was clearly degrading; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
