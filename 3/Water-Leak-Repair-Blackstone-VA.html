<p>As a locally-owned business, integrity and duty are incredibly essential to building a track record for excellence. One common method for a home's water supply to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which might end up being tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the problem could spread out greatly. A backflow preventer not just safeguards drinking water in individual houses, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from receding out and contaminating the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- normally salt. The outcome is water that's been efficiently softened by eliminating nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute hard water.</p>
