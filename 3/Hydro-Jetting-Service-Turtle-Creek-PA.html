<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
