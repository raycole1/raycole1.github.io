<p>Aside from these two important parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less crucial things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
