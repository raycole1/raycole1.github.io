<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts need to be gotten rid of and changed with new rubber parts. It is very important that only initial factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This activates the disc to open, allowing air to go into the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
