<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
