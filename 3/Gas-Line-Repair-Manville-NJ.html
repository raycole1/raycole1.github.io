The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a problem for homeowners. If installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help determine.</p>
