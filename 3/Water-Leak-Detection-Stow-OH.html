<p>If these combinations aren't successful in unclogging your sink, grab a typical household plunger. If you have a double sink, very first seal the 2nd side with a wet cloth or a stopper. You'll need to create a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you intend to plunge with sufficient water to cover the bell of the plunger.
