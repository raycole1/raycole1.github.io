If whatever is prepared, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be customized, replaced, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours required and therefore the total expenses. A lot of plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with a lot of disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>

If your disposal is clogged, don't use severe drain cleaning chemicals to attempt to unclog the system. Chemicals can damage the mechanical parts, shortening the life of the disposal.
