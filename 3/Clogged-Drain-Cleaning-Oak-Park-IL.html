<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Oak Park IL</h3>
<p>Rust is a complex phenomenon and there are many aspects that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and premise plumbing. For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that speed up deterioration Likewise, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of deterioration control. Thus, thinking about all these elements, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>

Lastly, if you own a septic tank, you should think about the extra load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates indicate that about 50 gallons of water are utilized for each regeneration cycle. This may or may not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
