<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>

Zurn Wilkins plumbing items that fall within this category have actually been designated lead-free," indicating they are compliant.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to a climatic vent.
