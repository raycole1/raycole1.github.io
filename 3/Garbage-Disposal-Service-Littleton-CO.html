<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the splendor in the toilet world, but the trip lever is the bridge between male and machine. After all, if the journey lever doesn't lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to jiggle and wiggle and sometimes even stick your hand in there and lift the flapper manually. And who wishes to do all that work???

<h3>Clogged Tub Drain in Littleton Colorado</h2>
<p>The most typical repairs plumbers encounter are clogged sinks and drains. Your kitchen is among the most plumbed rooms in the house, so this is where we frequently discover the clog. You need to never put coffee grounds in the garbage disposal. When damp, coffee grounds are reduced to a dense, thickly loaded wad of mush, which can clog drain lines and result in severe plumbing issues.</p>
<p>This is a completely legitimate question that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, obviously, as crucial as your water heater, water line, or drains. Nonetheless, it adds a fair amount of functionality to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a relatively little cylindrical device set up under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal system takes down wastewater and any material particles by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such particles. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>Our Fredericksburg toilet repair technicians can evaluate your issue and figure out the right solution to fix it. Whether we can carry out a repair or needs to recommend a replacement. Waste disposal unit can weigh 15 pounds. or more. That's a lot of weight to unexpectedly catch with one hand while you're turning the lower installing bracket with the other hand.</p>
