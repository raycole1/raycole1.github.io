The material has extremely developed structure of pores on the surface area of which are sites with easily caught and launched ions. This process of trapping of ions occurs with a synchronised releasing of other ions leading to the term ion-exchange. Ion exchange resins can be made to selectively choose one, or perhaps several different kinds of ions. Usually, these resins are based on cross-linked polystyrene.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, allowing air to bring back and enter the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
