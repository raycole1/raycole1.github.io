<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
