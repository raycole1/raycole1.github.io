<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive Muskegon MI</h3>
<p>Plumbing and piping technology has improved over the last 30 years. Copper has actually been the preferred option to replace galvanized iron pipes (which used to be considered very strong, but they were found to break under pressure and tend to corrode within a few years). Today, the majority of quality contractors use PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>Energy Performance. Picking a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is advisable. The energy efficiency of a storage water heater is suggested by its Energy Factor (EF). The more effective the hot water heater the greater the EF score. However, even if a hot water heater has a greater EF value, it does not always indicate it will have lower operating expense. You also have to think about the fuel source.</p>
