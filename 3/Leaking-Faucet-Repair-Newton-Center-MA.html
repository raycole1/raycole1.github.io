<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
