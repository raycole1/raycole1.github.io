<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Fort Meade FL</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leakages occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these concerns.</p>
