But utilizing PEX would cost just $4,000 to $6,000, according to Gove. Since of lower product and labor costs, that's. If it takes you 2 days to re-plumb a home with copper, you can do that same house in a day with PEX," states Emanuel.</p>
<p>The amount of warm water you use every day and whether your existing hot water heater is able to fulfill that demand. This amount is usually based on the number of people in your house. The immediate advantage to this transcends availability for houses and places with higher needs. While an electric heater might serve for smaller sized households, the gas heater might be a much better option for matching demands.</p>
