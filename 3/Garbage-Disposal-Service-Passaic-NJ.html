<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
