<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leaks.

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply.

Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
