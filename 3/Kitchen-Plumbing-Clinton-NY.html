While particle size decrease and plant development promo have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
