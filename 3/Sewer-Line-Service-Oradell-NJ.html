Some disposer units do not come with a power cord connected. If this holds true, remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1). Be sure to purchase an electrical wiring set with the appropriate power rating and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). When you link the circuitry harness to the disposer, ensure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cable.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
