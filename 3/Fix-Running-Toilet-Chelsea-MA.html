<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. There is potential for the infected water to end up being a health threat if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, as well as examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
