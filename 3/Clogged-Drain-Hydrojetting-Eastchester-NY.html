<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that ranges from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't set up effectively, you might experience a frequently or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in squandered water.</p>
