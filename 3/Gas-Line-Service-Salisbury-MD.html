<p>If you need a water softener is a personal preference, determining. A permit is not required for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions provided changes are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A normal water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a nearby drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to remove the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals carry favorable charges, so water softeners use sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you water with safe and clean water, you are required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection.
