<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Ballwin MO</h3>
<p>Contact your local licensed RainSoft dealership today to read more about the advantages of buying a water softening system for your home. In addition to our EC4 model, you can likewise inquire about our TC series water softeners, which offer likewise exceptional water softening benefits without the automated microprocessor controls of the EC4 system.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
