<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be tailored to your water requires. Your EcoWater Pro will evaluate your water to identify the right water treatment for your house. Because the softener's brine tank nests inside of the salt tank, a single tank or cabinet-style system requires less space.

While a high quality, high horsepower disposal can grind and press practically anything down the kitchen sink, it does not indicate it benefits the pipes. Gas shut-off valve installation costs between $52 and $138 per device, including labor and materials. Materials cost $15 to $50 per valve, while labor runs $45 to $150 per hour. A shut-off valve is needed to shut off the gas to the home whenever a home appliance needs repair or for emergencies.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We advise, as the majority of plumbers do, to utilize disposals moderately. Proper care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its guarantee and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
