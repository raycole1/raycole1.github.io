<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the problem, look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, continuous outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing totally. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water stains and corrosion. However do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
