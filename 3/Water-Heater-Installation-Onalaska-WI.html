<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Onalaska WI</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leakages happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these issues.</p>
<p>A new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the within used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the used pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. A few of those thin spots leak right now and often those leakages come days or weeks later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up needing to be appropriately re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
