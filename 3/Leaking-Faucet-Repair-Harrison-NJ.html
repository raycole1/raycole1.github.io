<p>If you observe an odor or unpleasant smell originating from your unit, which is not unusual, consider buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can get away. These flanges are easy and commonly offered to install, costing around $30 in your home enhancement or hardware shops. Turn off the water system to your house at the main line. To prevent leakages from springing throughout the installation process, shut off the supply of water to your home. Make sure your hot water heater's supply of water is switched off, as is the electrical power going to the system.</p>

<p>Throughout normal operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of decreased pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is designed to discharge and open water to the exterior. An RPZ will periodically discharge percentages of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ must be set up in areas that are exempt to water damage and enable sufficient drainage.</p>
