This can trigger low flow problems or perhaps stop a component from streaming altogether. The next common issue that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which occurs when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it lowers the readily available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
