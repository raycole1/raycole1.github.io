"Regenerating" refers to the method softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it becomes "tired" or full. However, numerous water softeners regenerate too often, when the filter medium actually isn't complete. This can be fixed by just resetting your water softener to eliminate less hardness or to run longer between regrowth cycles.</p>
