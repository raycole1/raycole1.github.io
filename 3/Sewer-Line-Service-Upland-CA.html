They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener alternative in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
