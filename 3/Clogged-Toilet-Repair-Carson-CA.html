<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts need to be gotten rid of and changed with brand-new rubber parts. It is important that just original factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to utilize and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>When the information collected from the field test indicates the assembly has actually broken down in its performance listed below the established minimum standard, backflow preventers need to only be fixed. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum basic, the backflow preventer need to be repaired or if necessary, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This suggests the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
