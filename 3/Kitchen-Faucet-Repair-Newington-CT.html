<p>Steamfitters and pipefitters, in some cases merely called fitters, install and keep pipes that might bring chemicals, acids, and gases. These pipes are mainly in manufacturing, commercial, and industrial settings. Fitters install and repair pipe systems in power plants, along with heating and cooling systems in large office buildings. Steamfitters focus on systems that are designed for the circulation of liquids or gases at high pressure. Other fitters might specialize as sprinklerfitters or gasfitters.</p>
<p>If you get your water from a neighborhood water supply, check to see if your community already softens the water. Soft water supplied by an utility does not need additional softening and might trigger corrosion issues for your house.
