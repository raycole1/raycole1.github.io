A plumbing inspection can help to determine whether you have actually got excess scaling within the pipes reducing the water pressure, or if there is a little leak that you don't understand about.</p>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend natural products, such as Bio-Clean, because they work better than items including harsh chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
