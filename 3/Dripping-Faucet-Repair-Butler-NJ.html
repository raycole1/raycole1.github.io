<p>A number of companies, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) offer certification courses created to train experts to check backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to end up being certified.</p>
<p>In municipal water supply systems, water is usually maintained at a considerable pressure to allow water to stream to and out of the plumbing components in your home or company. When the pressure drops for some factor such as may happen when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to combat a fire or a water main breaks or some other scenario happens, polluted water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an occurrence, there requires to be some type of backflow prevention method utilized. The very best and most safe type of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the component). If an air space is not possible, then the correct backflow prevention device is needed. This backflow device is thought about a containment" backflow preventer and is managed by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water provider.</p>
