<p>The best way to determine if your home has tough water is to bring a water sample to a water-testing lab. For about $90 approximately you'll receive a complete report, and not just about minerals.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
