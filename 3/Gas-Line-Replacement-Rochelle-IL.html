<p>As explained earlier in the post, carbon monoxide is colorless and totally odor-free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every home needs to have carbon monoxide gas detectors installed at the appropriate locations. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are usually sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all new installations should have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might have to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug kit that I purchased separately from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
