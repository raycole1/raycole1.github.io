<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Franklin IN</h3>
<p>In the majority of states, except Kansas, you are responsible for any natural gas piping on your residential or commercial property from our gas meter to your home or service. Atmos Energy does not preserve the gas lines on your home beyond our meter, this is the very same as other utilities, such as your electrical wiring and water pipes. When water enters your house from the main supply of water line, it must only ever stream in one direction: into your house.</p>
<p>When lime is added to the water, it alters the water chemistry, triggering the calcium to come out of the solution. The particles of calcium integrate, become heavier than the rest of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next step of the treatment process. Versatile gas lines are typically preferable to inflexible lines, especially in areas where earthquakes are more typical and for the connection between the supply and home appliance. Versatile gas lines are less likely to be detached in a natural catastrophe which reduces the risk of an explosion or fire.</p>
