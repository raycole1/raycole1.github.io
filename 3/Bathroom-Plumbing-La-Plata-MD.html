<h3>Cleaning Drains in La Plata Maryland</h2>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.
