We might hear the water heater making sounds, attempting to inform us there is an issue, however we neglect it which may result in a more extensive repair that if we would have nipped it in the bud. It's important to get out in front of any problems as quick as possible. The quicker you respond to an issue, the much better possibility you'll need to conserve time and money on water heater services.</p>
