<h3>Blocked Sink in Alachua Florida</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
