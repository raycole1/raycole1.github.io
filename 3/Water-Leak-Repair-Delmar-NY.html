<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>The use of backflow preventers is connected to the water's usage. Backflow preventers are utilized to ensure the safety and pureness of the distributed water. Commercial water supply generally has a minimum standard of quality, depending on the commercial procedure in question. Agriculture on the other hand has less strict water quality requirements. However where backflow preventers are most necessary is in the supply of drinkable water for domestic and personal use.</p>

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the cause of the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
