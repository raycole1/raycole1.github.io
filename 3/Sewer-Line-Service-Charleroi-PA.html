<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the safe and clean system providing the make-up water, backpressure is produced. This can require the potable water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Potential contaminants can then enter the safe and clean water supply. The very best method to lower accumulation is have a professional flush it at least when a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is specifically hard with high mineral content, you might need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
