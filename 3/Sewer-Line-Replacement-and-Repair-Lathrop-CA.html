In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, permitting air to get in the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>

Nevertheless, debris between the # 1 Inspect Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the components, is preventing the # 1 Check from closing all the way.

When this occurs, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
