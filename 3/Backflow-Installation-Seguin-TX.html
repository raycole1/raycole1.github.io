After we have cleaned the body, and the fixed parts are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be challenging, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed.
