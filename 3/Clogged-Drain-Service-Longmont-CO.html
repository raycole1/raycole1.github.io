The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health danger or health danger conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet).
