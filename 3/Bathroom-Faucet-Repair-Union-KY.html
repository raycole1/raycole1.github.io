<p>IRWD is committed to providing safe, high quality water to clients. Our comprehensive water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water provided to our consumers is kept free from harmful pollutants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices consisting of a nonpotable substance, this is known as a cross-connection. Contamination might occur when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating and cooling system, into the drinkable water supply. This can happen through a process called backflow.</p>

<p>You'll discover that water runs to refill the bowl Whenever you flush your toilet. Nevertheless, in an effectively working toilet, the water should stop running once the bowl is filled to its proper capacity. Chances are you have an internal leak and water is being disposed down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leakages are very inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up traveling through the overflow.</p>
<p>Galvanized water piping rusts and rusts internally. When drawing water from galvanized pipes, particles of rust, zinc, and other impurities flow into your drinking water.
