<h3>Four Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Bunker Hill WV</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system should be continually monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of home centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
