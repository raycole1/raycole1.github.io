When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. If enabled to return to the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
