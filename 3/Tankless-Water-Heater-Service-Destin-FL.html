Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.

The heating temperature is typically pre-set to fit your requirements and preferences. Tankless electric hot water heater use less power than traditional water heaters because they just heat water when required.</p>
