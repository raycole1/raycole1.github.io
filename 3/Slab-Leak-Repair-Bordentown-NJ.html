<p>If your hot water heater has actually required multiple repairs over the last few years, it might be time to get it changed. A good general rule for water heaters is this: because the life-span of the typical hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your water heater.</p>
<p>Other indications you may need to repipe consist of rust in your water supply, low water pressure, and damp areas in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these are common indications that precede repiping services, they do not always indicate repiping is the only solution.
