<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc designed and built a smaller sized model that ran on the very same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and municipal sewer pipes.

It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger trouble too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
