<p>The client has 30 days to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notification of Requirements form).

In some instances, the toilet may be too old, and replacement parts are not readily available, so a replacement toilet is needed.</p>
<p>The drains in the typical house get continuous use. Hair, food scraps, soap residue, and other debris can gradually develop with time.

<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
