<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Oil City PA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leaks occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these problems.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as difficult water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
