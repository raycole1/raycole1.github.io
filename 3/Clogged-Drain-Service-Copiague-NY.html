Backsiphonage happens when there is a negative pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a private water system into the general public water system. This can occur at any time, such as throughout a water main break or during a big firefighting effort.</p>
<p>In many cases, a lack of hot water is brought on by a defective circuit breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. If the water is lukewarm, the dip tube inside the tank may be broken. Scalding water is normally the outcome of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water threatens and should be immediately dealt with by a trained plumbing professional.</p>
