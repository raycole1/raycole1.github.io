<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't set up appropriately, you might experience a frequently or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>
