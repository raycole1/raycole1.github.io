Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
