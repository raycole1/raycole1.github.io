<p>Both methods are highly efficient and lowering waste and clearing it. The most significant distinction remains in timing. With a batch disposal, you fill the system, cover it, then turn it on. If it's entirely full, it will take a bit to clear through the waste, and if you discover you forgot something, you need to wait till it's done to put the new waste in.</p>
<p>The toilet takes a really long period of time to flush. Here's how it works: During regular operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves-- referred to as the zone of minimized pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve ought to leak, the relief valve is created to discharge and open water to the outdoors, ensuring backflow never takes place.</p>
