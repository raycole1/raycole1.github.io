<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct result on your security, benefit, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is very essential! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system. Current guidelines limit the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We offer two types of water treatment systems for hard water: Advantage Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>Foul odors originating from your sink or from your bathtub. Like sewage smells, foul smells are a sign that you are suffering from a plumbing problem. There may be blocking in your pipe system or the trap on your drain might be broken or excessively dry. We offer energy efficient hot water heater solutions fulfilling the NAECA performance standards. If you have an old water heater, you may consider upgrading to one of these energy effective hot water heater that uses a cost savings on your energy expenses, and quicker healing times.</p>

<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 factor our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a house is due to the fact that there is excessive hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are simple and pretty low-cost to install, so there's no factor not to. Ultimately causing a backup when grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and prevents water circulation. This included with other particles in your drain can trigger a major backup.</p>
