<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>

<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and in other places during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
