<p>As pipes age, the most likely they are to corrode and burst. This is just amplified depending on the product of the pipes utilized in your house.

When your house begins to approach this age, you should start getting more regular inspections and maintenance checks on your plumbing to ensure you don't have any leaks or damage establishing in your home.</p>
