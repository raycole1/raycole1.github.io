Using his understanding and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the particles decreased the newly cleaned up main drain. By including perseverence and perseverance the task was done to my total satisfaction.</p>
