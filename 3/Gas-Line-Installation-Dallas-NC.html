<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
