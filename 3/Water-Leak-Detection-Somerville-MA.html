<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the reason for the problem. The line was plainly degrading; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
