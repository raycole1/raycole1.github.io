<p>Sewer lines can stop working for a range of reasons, consisting of poor soil conditions, clogs from grease and grime, and deterioration. Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, especially in older communities where clay pipe may have been utilized.

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to enter the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard.
