<p>Backflow preventers are critical for producing a safe water system system. No matter which model you select, all water softeners need to be effectively maintained. The brine service should be combined and saved in the brine tank. Regular clogging of the resin likewise needs special attention. For instance, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, regular backwashing with water will resolve this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the material. Likewise, germs and fungis also form mats in the resin that lower its effectiveness. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these annoyances. However, check out the maker's guidelines before including any chemicals to the system.</p>
