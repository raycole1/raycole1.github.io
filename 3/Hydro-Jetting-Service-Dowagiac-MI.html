By having the anode rod examined routinely and replaced as required, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Waste disposal unit are a vital feature in any modern-day kitchen. If you reside in an older house, your sink may not have one, requiring you to be diligent about keeping food scraps from streaming down the drain.

At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This reversal can create a suction result and draw prospective pollutants into the safe and clean (drinking) water supply. Storage tank water heaters are frequently found in most houses. Their components are an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water up until it's required. A pipe emerges from the top to deliver warm water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
<p>At least once every 3 months, drain water from the tank.

To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to consider repiping your whole home when you spot a leak.</p>
