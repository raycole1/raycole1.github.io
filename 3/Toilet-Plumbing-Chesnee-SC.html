<p>Other pipe repair techniques include our Pipe Pull technique and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull method interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into location. All brand-new replacement pipes have a forecasted lifespan of one a century and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another effective technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially eliminates the need for broken pipe elimination. By inserting a hardening lining product which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a new pipe is developed inside the broken one.</p>
