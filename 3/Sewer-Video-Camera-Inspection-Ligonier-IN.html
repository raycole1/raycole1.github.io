<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can become polluted. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health threat if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for efficiency, in addition to examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
