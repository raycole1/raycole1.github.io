<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow direction within a piping system that is triggered by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
