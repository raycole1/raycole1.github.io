If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet.

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't set up appropriately, you may experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in squandered water.</p>
