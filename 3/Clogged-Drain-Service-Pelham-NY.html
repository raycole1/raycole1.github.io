Directing happens when the inbound difficult water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of decades, but steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of three to five months after occupancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Numerous brand-new homes are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
