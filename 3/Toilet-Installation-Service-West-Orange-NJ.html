<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your house can be found near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Caution: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Even if copper is revealing does not indicate you do not have polybutylene pipes. You may have to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>However, you also need to think about the age of your system.
