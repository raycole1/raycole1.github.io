<p>The program achieves its objective by attending to the adoption and promulgation of suitable rules and regulations for the construction of plumbing centers where mandated. When identifying the firmness of water, there are ranges of grains per gallon (gpg). Rinckey stated that both Belding and Greenville city water measures around 18 gpg, which is considered exceptionally difficult water, leaving indications like spotty glasses and soap residue that is next to difficult to get rid of.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
