To get your waste disposal unit working once again, you will initially wish to use a flashlight to look for foreign objects lodged in the drum's openings.

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close.
