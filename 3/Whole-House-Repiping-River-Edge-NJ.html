<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health hazard if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
<p>If your hot water heater has actually required numerous repairs over the last few years, it might be time to get it changed. An excellent guideline for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more monetary sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
<p>A double check backflow preventer features two spring-loaded check assemblies to avoid back siphonage and back pressure on non-health threat (low threat) systems. Unscrew the coupling nut that connects the supply line. If the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank, hold its base with a locking pliers. Tip: Toss a towel on the floor beneath to capture water that will drain from the line.</p>
