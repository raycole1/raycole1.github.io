<p>Does it seem like your drains are constantly slow or clogged? Typically, this is triggered by built-up sediment and other materials that are triggering a blockage in your sewer drain. Where other drain cleaning and plumbing companies will attempt to charge you a leg and an arm to collect and clean your sewer line, Northwest Drain Station uses hydro jetting, an extremely effective service for dislodging persistent products that have actually stayed with the walls of your pipeline, restoring a healthy flow to your drains.</p>
<p>If you 'd like to eliminate the salt, just fill the brine tank with potassium chloride pellets, not salt pellets. The only issue is that potassium chloride is pricey: $25 to $30 per 50-pound bag. Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag. A hydro jetter is a pump-and-hose system that utilizes high-powered water jets to clear residential and commercial drain pipes. Most high-pressure water jetters will run with as much as 4,000 PSI of pressure and will press anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
