<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
