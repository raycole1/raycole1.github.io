<p>Understand that softened water contains trace amounts of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water consists of about the very same quantity of salt as a piece of bread. That's not quite salt, however for those on a strict sodium-free diet it may be too much. If this does not work, you may need to replace one of your toilet's parts, normally the flapper. There might likewise be a concern with the chain attached to the float or the flapper ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
