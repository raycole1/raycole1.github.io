<p>Since plumbing is a trade profession, individuals who wish to become plumbers need to satisfy certain requirements. There is visible rust on the hot water heater tank. However utilizing PEX would cost simply $4,000 to $6,000, according to Gove. That's because of lower material and labor expenses. If it takes you 2 days to re-plumb a house with copper, you can do that exact same home in a day with PEX," says Emanuel.</p>
<p>While many hot water heater problems can be successfully fixed, some issues will require complete hot water heater replacement. If your hot water heater is past its typical lifespan (normally anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless hot water heater) or if it has a significant leak or comprehensive rust, it may be time to consider replacement.</p>
