<p>Pipefitters and steamfitters, sometimes simply called fitters, install and preserve pipes that may carry acids, chemicals, and gases. These pipes are mainly in production, commercial, and commercial settings. Fitters repair and install pipe systems in power plants, along with heating and cooling systems in large office buildings. Steamfitters concentrate on systems that are created for the circulation of liquids or gases at high pressure. Other fitters may specialize as sprinklerfitters or gasfitters.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of house centers carry just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close.
