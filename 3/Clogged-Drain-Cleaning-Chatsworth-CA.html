<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have actually been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
