If we have actually made a mistake or utilized a defective part, don't hesitate to let us understand. Since we stand behind our work, we will constantly take your phone calls and fix the issue.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to bring back and get in the valve pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric standard. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
