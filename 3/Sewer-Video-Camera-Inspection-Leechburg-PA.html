An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment including a nonpotable substance, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination may take place when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating & cooling system, into the safe and clean water supply. This can take place through a process known as backflow.</p>
