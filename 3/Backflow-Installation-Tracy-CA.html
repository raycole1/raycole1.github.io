<p>The consumer has one month to complete installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (inspect the due date on Notification of Requirements form). Most of the time, a professional plumber can come out and discover the issue and make the repairs. In some instances, the toilet may be too old, and replacement parts are not readily available, so a replacement toilet is required.</p>
<p>When the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might take place. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Non-potable and potable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system if these connections are not correctly protected.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the culprit. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with too little slack can trigger problem too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
