<p>Other pipe repair techniques include our Pipe Pull method and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull method interchanges harmed sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into place. All new replacement pipes have a forecasted life-span of one a century and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another efficient method is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically gets rid of the need for broken pipe removal. By placing a solidifying lining product which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a brand-new pipe is created inside the broken one.</p>
