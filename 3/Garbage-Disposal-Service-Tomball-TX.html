<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically maintained at a substantial pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might fail or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health threat if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
