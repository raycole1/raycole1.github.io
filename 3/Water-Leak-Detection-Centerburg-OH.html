<p>IRWD is committed to providing safe, high quality water to customers. Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water provided to our clients is kept devoid of hazardous pollutants. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices consisting of a nonpotable substance, this is known as a cross-connection. Contamination may take place when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or cooling and heating system, into the safe and clean water system. This can happen through a procedure called backflow.</p>
<p>2 styles of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes a separately acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. A PVB may be utilized to isolate health or non-health dangers but is effective versus back-siphonage just.</p>
