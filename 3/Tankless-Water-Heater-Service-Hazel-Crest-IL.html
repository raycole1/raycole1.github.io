<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on.
