<p>Ideally, you'll never ever discover the need for water or waste line repairs in your house. You certainly don't need us to tell you, however, that we are not residing in an ideal world.

<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is heated directly whenever it's needed. Tankless systems specifically utilize an element that warms up water when the tap is turned on. The water is continuously heated up as long as the tap remains on. If the tap is immediately switched off, the water stops being heated up. The heating temperature is normally pre-set to fit your preferences and requirements. Tankless electrical water heaters use less power than traditional water heaters due to the fact that they just heat water when required.</p>
