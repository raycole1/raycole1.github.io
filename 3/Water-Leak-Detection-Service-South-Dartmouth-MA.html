<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
