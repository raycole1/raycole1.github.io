Chlorinated Polyvinylchloride Piping (CPVC) piping products cost from $0.40 to $1.56 per linear foot. A popular replacement product for metal pipes, CPVC pipe is stiff plastic piping that has thick walls and can be used for cold and hot drinking pipes. CPVC is easy to install and fulfills the most rigorous building codes.</p>
<p>Solar hot water heater: These environmentally friendly and economical heaters draw energy from the sun to heat water. They need no electrical energy or gas and can lower your costs by an estimated 14 to 18%. If you're relatively inexperienced, a hot water heater installation is not the repair on which to sharpen your plumbing abilities. So conserve yourself some major difficulty by being honest with yourself about where your experience level is.</p>
