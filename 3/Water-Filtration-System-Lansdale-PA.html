We will guarantee you understand your options, the disadvantages and advantages, and make a suggestion so you can make an educated choice. A waste disposal unit usually plugs into a 120-volt GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruptor) outlet under the sink. You'll have to have an electrical contractor install one if an outlet like this isn't available under your sink.</p>
