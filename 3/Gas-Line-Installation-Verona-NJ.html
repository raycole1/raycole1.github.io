We supply gas water heater service, along with electrical water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Shore.</p>
<p>Some states require steamfitters and pipefitters to be licensed; they might also need a special license to deal with gas lines. Licensing typically requires a test or work experience or both.
