<p>The repair technician must be able to determine the lots of different manufacturers and the particular models produced throughout the years. Some designs might seem similar on the outdoors but might need different repair parts on the inside, so the repair technician must be able to determine the make, model and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that may have been produced. Often the serial number of the assembly will be required to distinguish one model from another. It is very important to understand the appropriate design to assure you get the appropriate repair parts.</p>
<p>Hard water causes a greater threat of lime scale deposits in household water systems. Due to this lime scale accumulation, pipes are blocked and the efficiency of hot boilers and tanks is lowered. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent. Dark Blue = Supply-side pressure (for instance, 100 psi) presses against the # 1 check and also fills the area on the "high pressure" side of the Relief Valve diaphram, pressing it closed.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the offender. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
