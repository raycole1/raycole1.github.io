<p>You'll see that water runs to refill the bowl Whenever you flush your toilet. However, in an appropriately working toilet, the water needs to stop running as soon as the bowl is filled to its appropriate capacity. If your toilet continues to run, chances are you have an internal leak and water is being disposed down the overflow. These leakages are incredibly wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up traveling through the overflow.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the culprit. But not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger problem too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
