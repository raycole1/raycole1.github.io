<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some disposer units do not come with a power cable connected. If this is the case, remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1). Be sure to purchase an electrical wiring kit with the appropriate power ranking and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). When you connect the electrical wiring harness to the disposer, ensure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cable.</p>
