Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

<p>Typical fixes don't resolve the issue. If it appears you're constantly experiencing plumbing problems, it's more than likely a problem you can't fix without professional aid. A licensed plumber can not just discover that cause of the problem but securely repair or replace your main sewer line if needed.
