<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Many homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition security. As the external finishing of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
